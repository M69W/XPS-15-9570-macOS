----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CTRL-21712: Connection failed after resuming from Win10 Modern Standby
      Cause:
        When system entering/resuming from sleep, OS asks driver to put device into D3/D0. 
        Driver needs to set up phy and wait for around 2.5 secs to get the link status
        from phy. With Modern Standby, driver was asked to set device to D3 and D0 in very
        short time (around 0.1 sec) which causes driver cannot get the correct link status
        and indicate link status to OS correctly.
      Change:
        When system resuming from standby, driver receives the link status change interrupt
        from device, driver will check the link status from phy and do the link up indication
        correctly.
      Impact:
        None

      Cause:
        Driver tried to check Rx ring producer index in the DPC, but used wrong index, the
        index should be from 0 to 3 (device has max 4 rss rings enabled), but 5 is used.
      Change:
        Make driver to check Ring ring produer with correct index number. 
      Impact:
        None

        Use NonPagedPoolNx parameter instead.
      Impact:
        None

Version 17.2.0.1  Jun 09, 2015
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CTRL-20638 : System hang observed on OEM system when booting up.
      Cause:
        Transmit path appears to hang at the first frame after power-on reset.
      Change:
        Checks the DMA length register values before initiating any transmit traffic
        and applies CQ59486 workaround if it detects the failure condition.

Version 17.2.0.0  Apr 10, 2015
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CTRL-20475 : Server crashed on "b57nd60a.sys" while doing continuous upgrade/downgrade of firmwares.
      Cause:
        Driver gets timeout while trying to acquire main spinlock in a timer function because the other driver
        thread (servicing private OID passed down from BMAPI to put driver into diag mode) doesn’t finish it
        task yet, the spinlock is not released yet. 
      Change:
        Fwupg/BMAPI puts driver into diag mode first before passing down other commands/OIDs to program nvram. 
        When driver is working in diag mode, the timer function should do nothing and return immediately. 
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CTRL-20424 : 5720 doesn't work under Win2012 R2 after adding Hyper-V service without virtual switch.
      Cause:
        When OS tells driver to assign 4th RSS queue (#3) to 49th CPU (#48), driver fails with the NDIS call 
        NdisMConfigMSIXTableEntry() because driver doesn't allocate resource for mapping to 49th CPU during 
        initialization. Driver doesn't allocate enough interrupt resources because driver was told there are 
        48 RSS capable CPUs and Hyper-Threading is disabled, however there are actually 64 CPUs activated.
      Change:
        Make driver to get correct number of activated CPUs and allocate interrupt resources accordingly. 
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CTRL-20506 : Customer is experiencing traffic stoppage using 5715 NICs on system using Win2008 x64.
      Cause:
        Driver received a tx packet from upper layer with an invalid physical address, it hits 5715 
        errata #23403 and cause device traffic to stop.
      Change:
        Check if the physical address is above 1TB or not, if it does, driver will copy the packet data to 
        a pre-allocated data buffer and send it out from there.
      Impact:
        None

  4.  Problem:
        CTRL-20516 : 5720 traffic stops after transmitting large (32K) frame with DNF set.
      Cause:
        Driver receives NBL (Net Buffer List) that specifies LSO transmit information, but with MSS = 0 (Maximum Segment Size), 
        then driver passes the packet (with 32K bytes) to device directly that make device tx doesn't work anymore.
      Change:
        Don't send the NBL with the invalid information (specifies LSO with MSS = 0). 
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Don't put tx timestamp into the OOB structure in MiniportReserved[1] before calling the send complete handler.
      Change:
        The intermediate driver will use a private OID to get tx timestamp instead.
      Impact:
        None

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CTRL-20407 : Link not recognized on system with 64 cores.
      Cause:
        Driver was using a 32-bit parameter for getting target CPU in ISR, this makes 
        driver code (servicing link status change interrupt in DPC) not executed correctly.
      Change:
        Use 64-bit parameter to get target CPU for DPC.
      Note:
        The issue happens with device using MSI interrupt only, not MSI-X.

  Enhancements:

        CQ73909 - add Rx/Tx buffer size tuning for OEM systems.
      Change:
        Add transmit/receive buffer setting registry keys for specific OEM systems.
      Impact:
        None

Version 17.0.0.1  Sep 19, 2014
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ73792 : after setting *JumboPacket registry, driver does not report expected max frame size.
      Change:
        Make device to work on correct Jumbo Packet Mode, then driver will report expected size while 
        processing OID_GEN_MAXIMUM_FRAME_SIZE.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ73827 : When plug in two 5722 NICs on the same system, one of the NIC is not functioning sometimes.
      Cause:
        When device generates MSI interrupt, driver’s ISR is called, driver queues two DPCs for them on two 
        different CPUs (one for the CPU gets interrupt, another for RSS target CPU). There is a chance that
        driver may mess up the internal RST parameter/flag, this make driver falsely think the DPC has not
        been completed and then it will not enable the interrupt. This makes device can not generate interrupt 
        for rx/tx packets anymore
      Change:
        Make driver doesn't touch RST parameters while it's not running DPC for RSS target CPU.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CQ73852 : device shows link down randomly and is unable to pass traffic.
      Cause:
        There is a driver bug introduced by CQ73695 fix which makes driver doesn't handle interrupt resource
        assignment correctly when the total CPU number is larger than device's MSI-X vectors.
      Change:
        Add changes to correct the error.
      Impact:
        None

Version 17.0.0.0  Sep 09, 2014
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ73695 - Driver only gets one MSI interrupt with specific numproc and groupsize configuration.
      Cause:
        With special configuration, driver doesn’t set interrupt message affinity correctly.      
      Change:
        Add code change to make driver handle the special configuration properly.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ73739 - OEM System: 30% performance reduction found with Jumbo 4088 Bytes testing.
      Cause:
        The current driver indicates one packet at a time to OS and inserts Receive Buffer Descriptors
        to device one by one when Jumbo Packet is enabled. With specific system, when CPU is not power 
        enough, CPU is exhausted (getting 100% usage) during the test.
      Change:
        Driver to indicate multiple packets and inserts multiple RBDs to device at a time.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ73756 -  port 1 get disconnected status on Server2008 x86.
      Cause:
        Device doesn't generate interrupt because MSI enabled bit was not eanbled.
      Change:
        For 5715, the GRC reset will reset MSI enable bit as well, so driver needs to restore it. 
        Make driver to save/restore the MSI capability registers correctly in a x86 system.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ73764 - System gets BSOD while running BACS Diagnostics stress on 5719.
      Cause:
        Driver was making two continuous spin lock acquisitions. One comes from UM_QueryInformation(),
        when BACS passes T3_OID_DIAG_SUSPEND to driver, the other one comes from UM_CheckForHang().
      Change:
        Make driver not to acquire spin lock in UM_CheckForHang while driver is running in diagnostic mode.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ73829 - Traffic stopped when setting Receive Buffer size to Minimum and flow control to Rx enable
      Cause:
        The minimum number of "Receive Buffers" was set to smaller than rx replenish threshold, there is a
        chance that driver may not be able to insert RBDs to device anymore.
      Change:
        Modify minimum value of "Receive Buffers" from 16 to 64.
      Impact:
        None.

        BIOS SMI handler with specific operations which allows OEM BIOS to 
        interrogate the state of the controller first.
      Impact:
        None


Version 16.6.0.2  Mar 12, 2014
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ73199 - WHCK: WOL_Pattern test fail on "Send and wake test with matching wake packet failed"

Version 16.6.0.1  Feb 27, 2014
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ73082 - 5762 fails to wake up by magic packet with a certain OS configuration steps.
      Cause:
        This issue occurs when the OS does not pass down the WoL patterns, the firmware will flag
        it as OS is absent. The OS absent mode will cause the firmware to take a code path that
        will set the port mode to be GMII instead of MII. Magic packet detection will not work
        if the port mode is in GMII.
      Change:
        Do not flag the mode as OS absent when there are no WoL patterns.
      Impact:

Version 16.4.0.0  Oct 03, 2013
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ69498 - traffic stop observed with network stress test with jumbo MTU=9000
      Cause:
        Driver allocates RBD(receive buffer descriptor) more than device's receive return ring size (configured by driver).
        Under heavy traffic(mix of small and jumbo packets), driver will be busy processing small packets and the speed 
        of driver servicing rx packet may not be fast enough, there is a chance that "receive return ring producer index" will 
        exceed or equal to "receive return consumer index". When "receive return producer index" = "receiver return consumer
        index", driver thinks it has completed servicing all incoming rx packets, but actually ring is full and there are 
        packets waiting for driver to process.
      Change:
        Configure the size of Receive Return Ring larger than the number of allocated RBDs.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Use custom DPC to improve the latency for EAV traffic send completion.
      Note:

      Change:
        Restore the change and use another solution for CQ69565.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:

      Cause:
        Driver doesn't follow NdisOidComplete rule to return requested NTSTATUS values while handling OID_PM_REMOVE_WOL_PATTERN.
      Change:
        Return NDIS_STATUS_SUCCESS when wol pattern is not found.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 16.2.0.2  Jul 24, 2013
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ70116 - 5725 IPMI "Get Self Test Result" failed during power cycle test.
      Cause:

      Change:
        When system crashes, driver will collect related APE Info (APE shared memory, APE Control register, 
        GRC register, Management Filter register, Scratch Pad..) into memory dump.
      Note:
        There is a kernel extension which can save the data in the a binary for bmimgdbg.exe to analyze.

Version 16.2.0.1  Jul 05, 2013
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ69875 - When device gets single MSI-X vector assignment from OS, 5719/5720 can't send/receive packets normally.
      Cause:
        OS has resource assignment problem with some NICs, OS sets device’s MSI-X table entry with *SAME* address 
        and message data  for all 17 vectors, however OS tells driver that it has 17 MSI-X interrupt resources to use 
        in MiniportFilterResourceRequirementsHandler(), this makes driver run the code path for multi-vector msi-x mode
        and it’s causing problem.
      Change:
        Check the MSI-X table entry during initialization, if there is duplicated, driver falls back to single-vector RSS mode. 
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        57762: system gets BSOD when driver is loaded.
      Cause:

      Change:
        Ignore NCSI managed flag while refreshing host memory.  
      Impact:
        None


Version 15.0.0.9  Jul 18, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ56840 - system gets BSOD while remove BASP teaming adapter in Hyper-V "Virtual Network Manager".
      Cause:
        Driver is getting incorrect CPU count (using NdisSystemProcessorCount) in the particular system
        which has been configured as "Number of processors" = 1. This causes driver to run the RSS code
        path which it shouldn't.
      Change:
        Use another way to get correct CPU count and disable RSS support accordingly while "Number of 
        processors" is 1.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  2.  Problem:
        CQ55452 - OEM NC-Series Broadcom 1Gb Driver is showing update return an error for w2k8_R2x64bit
      Cause:
        The device IDs are not in the OEM inf file's win7 section.        
      Change:
        Add the device IDs in the OEM inf file's win7 section.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ56841 - BASP teaming adpter binding with hyper-v makes system unable to get DHCP IP. 
      Cause:
        The RSS talble size is 0 in this particular configuration but device is still able to generate
        MSI-X interrupt on CPU number larger than RSS ring size (4). There is a coding error that driver 
        may incorrectly ignore MSI-X interrupt so device doesn't service tx/rx packets anymore. 
      Change:
        Correct the code to handle this particular configuration properly.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ57101 - No counter of LSO transmit requests in BACS4 statistics.
      Cause:
        LSO related registry keys don't stick in registry during driver installation. 
      Change:
        Make change in inf file to override registry key's default value as a workaround.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  5.  Problem:
        System hits breakpoint while running VMQTestingOIDs with check version driver.
      Cause: 
        The fix in v14.8.1.5 resolves the interrupt storm (by driver’s updating incorrect tag value) 
        when VMQ is freed. However, the same problem happens when driver enables interrupt for VMQ during 
        initialization. Driver enables interrupt in VmqInitialize() with tag value 0, device generates
        msi-x interrupt because device’s internal state of tag value is 1.
      Change:
        Make a workaround to force a status block update (without interrupt) to get the latest/correct
        interrupt tag value and then enable the interrupt with the tag value (synced with device's).
      Note:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        Workaround for FUNC_MODE[] inputs are not HW strapped
      Change:
        Check the signature in from Rx CPU shared memory (0xe00, deposited by bootcode), if it's invalid,
        driver will read CPMU status directly from register 0x362C.
      Impact:
        None 

  2.  Request
        For OEM specific feature enhancement.
      Change:
        Pass device's LSO and Checksum offload information to NCSI while driver is loaded.
      Impact:
        None


Version 15.0.0.8  Jul 07, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ56510 - 5719 Production NIC_A1 - RSS doesn't work when setting the number of processors to 1
      Cause:
        There is an incorrect check added in ISR routine.        
      Change:
        Remove the incorrect check in ISR routine. 
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ56612 - 57781B0 fail to detect linkdown with EEE is enabled and connecting to a non-EEE target
      Cause:
        Interoperability issue workaround which should not be applied to a non-EEE target.
      Change:
        Remove interoperability issue workaround for a non-EEE target.          
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ56766 - Frimware upgraded failed with 5719 when EEPROM is used for self-boot. 
      Cause:
        Driver is not using the correct nvram strapping for recognizing eeprom devices.
      Change:
        Correct the nvram strapping map for the eeprom devices used by 5719.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ56286 - OEM reports the super charger will show error message when both RSS and hyper threading are enabled. 
      Cause:
        The default MSIX messages are not enough if the msix vectors are smaller than the processors number.
      Change:
        Add more MSIX messages if need to make one MSIX message per processors at least.    
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ56644 - 5719-A1: System BSOD when run Load/unload.
      Cause:
        The non-zero MSIX messages are still used when RSS is not set.
      Change:
        Use the non-zero MSIX messages even RSS is not set.    
      Impact:
        None.
                
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ56540 - OEM 5719 system: driver did not include Jumbo Frame and LSO.
      Change:
        The JumboFrame and LSO entries were removed for 5719 A0, now it's added for OEM system with 5719 A1.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request
        CQ56099 - Please add 4-part IDs for specific OEM. 
      Change:
        Make inf change as requested.
      Note:
        The inf changes added in v15.0.0.6 is incorrect (SVID is not correct)

  3.  Request
        CQ56550,CQ56551 - Please add 4-part IDs for specific OEM. 
      Change:
        Make inf change as requested.
      Note:
        None

  4.  Request
        Workaround for FUNC_MODE[] inputs are not HW strapped
      Change:
        Instead of reading cpmu status from reg 0x362c, reading the data from Rx CPU shared memory (0xe00) deposited by bootcode.
      Note:
        None 


Version 15.0.0.7  Jun 22, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ53065 - Cotopaxi-5719: EEE- Link down and link up on 100M speed with APSM enabled(0x41, 0x42, 0x43)
      Change:
        Change a EEE setting for 100MB EEE link flap issue.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  2.  Problem:
        CQ56393 - 5720 - OEM: Random BSOD when reloading b57 driver

        There are some spurious irq before RSS parameters are set.
      Change:
        Ignore the spurious irq.
      Impact:
        None.
             
  3.  Problem:
        CQ56383 - 5720_A0- The DPCs rate does not work as expected when toggling RSS Queues.
      Cause:
        RSSv1 (Vista, w2k8 and older) could give the driver a rss table with more processors than the number 
        of queues the driver advertised.        
      Change:
        Workaround it by making the processor number equal to the number of RSS queue.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ56417 - Snaggletooth: 5720A0-Fiber bindding Hyper-V with BASP will cause BSOD.
      Cause:
        The fix of CQ56393 is still have a hole.
      Change:
        Fix the hole and ignore the spurious irq on a corner case.
      Impact:
        None.        

  Enhancements:
  =============

      Impact:
        None.

                       
Version 15.0.0.6  Jun 16, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ55592 - 5718 B0: KeepAlive.htm of NDISTest6.5 WOL failure on Hyper threading with enabled
      Cause:
        It's hardware bug where writing to RxCPU scratchpad memory 0xC00350XX would also write to 
        APE Mutex area 0xC00150XX. This makes driver always get time-out while trying to obtain
        APE Mutex for read/write GPHY. During this period, device is not able to pass traffic 
        because driver is still busy in initializing the device.
      Change:
        Reduce code size by removing code that are not used by PM Offload firmware. 
        Thus avoiding the affected scratchpad memory area (0xC00350XX).
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ55652 - 57785x : it takes multiple interesting packets to wake up SUT when link speed is 100M.
      Cause:
        Device may not be able to latch interesting packet when TL_CLK is running slower than RX_CLK.
      Change:
        Make driver not to set bit_26 of reg 0x400 (Free Running ACPI), this makes ACPI h/w stay in 
        "match" state after detecting an interesting packet.
      Impact:
        The change is for 57785/57765 family devices only.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ55277 - WinFWUpg v7.0.43: 5720 (M45PE40) after upg ncsi run crc will failed in "APE fw" and "iscsi cfg prog".
      Cause:
        NVRAM manual strapping is set on the 5720 board.        
      Change:
        Add NVRAM manual strapping support in the driver for 5720.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ55253 - Disabling RSS provides better CPU scaling result
      Cause:
        The RSS indirect table is not setup correctly when CPU hyper-threaded is enable on a 64bit system.        
      Change:
        Correct the RSS indirect table setup on a 64bit system when CPU hyper-threaded enable.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ56026 - 5718 fiber-Link up(OS) on Playdead port while establish pass-through in 2K8-R2
      Cause:
        Driver is indicating connected status to OS while it should not.
      Change:
        Make driver not to indicate any link status while device is in playdead mode.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ55772 - Add 4 part ID support for copper in NDIS5 and NDIS6 drivers with 5719 and 5720 
      Change:
        Make inf change as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request
        CQ55763 - Modify existing 2 part ID match to add the "Copper Only" in advanced property settings
      Change:
        Make inf change as requested. The "(Copper only)" are added in the following settings

      Impact:
        None.


Version 15.0.0.5  May 19, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ55539 - Sawtooth B0: VMQScalability.htm of NDISTest6.5 VMQ failure on Hyper threading with enabled
      Change:
        Setup MSIx vectors on the processors including hyper-threading processors.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ55346 - 5720: System gets BSOD (bugcheck D1) during NDISTest6.5 VMQ testing in DELL R910 16-Cores
      Cause:
        During NDISTest VMQ tests, NDISTest asks driver to allocate/free VMQs multiple times. There is a racing
        condition that NDISTest may send out packets from server to client while VMQ initialization is not 
        completed yet, but VMQ's interrupt is already enabled. So device will generate interrupts for driver
        to service rx packets for the VMQ, this causes driver to reference an invalid memory address.
      Change:
        Disable VMQ's interrupt when it's freed.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  3.  Problem:
        CQ55682 - WinFWUpg tool corrupts the NVRAM on 5720 after MBA upgrade
      Cause:
        Same root caused of CQ55277 for another type of NVRAM.
      Change:
        Add support for more types of NVRAM with the correct strapping info.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ55635 - Update Product_Version String to 16.8.0 for Release 14.8
      Change:
        Change the product version as required.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 15.0.0.4  May 10, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ54056 - BSOD 0xD1 or traffic stop observed when running copy compare test on OEM's platform               
      Change:
        1. Set FTS to 44 for 57761/57765/57781/57785 B0 family devices only.
        2. Apply CQ55444 workaround on 57761/57765/57781/57785 B0 family devices as well.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ55464 - b57vista v15.0.0.3: 5719 and 5720 install driver will error code under W2k8x86 and Vistax86.               
      Cause:
        NdisGetRssProcessorInformation API is not available under NDIS 6.20
      Change:
        Check the function before calling it.        
      Impact:
        None.
                
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ55444 - Tx small fragments (less than 8 bytes) coalesce workaround should be applied for all effect controllers. 
      Change:
        For all affected devices, coalesce SBDs if there is a SBD with length less or equal than 8 bytes.


Version 15.0.0.3  May 09, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        *RssBaseProcNumber for RSS is not supported by the driver. 
      Change:
        Add support and change the RSS base processor number based on the registry key.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ55277 - WinFWUpg v7.0.43: 5720 after upg ncsi run crc will failed in "APE fw" and "iscsi cfg prog".
      Cause:
        5720 NVRAM strapping for eeprom AT45DB021D is different.
      Change:
        Add support for it.
      Impact:
        None.
        
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ55003 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.
        
  2.  Request:
        CQ54401 - Disable Force Auto Negotiation when the current link speed at S0 matches 
        the intended S5 link speed
      Change:
        Don't reset and force Auto Negotiation on the PHY if "Port Flap Avoidance" 
        is enable in NVRAM configutation
      Impact:
        [1] no port flap during driver load/unload while in S0 with NCSI enabled 
        [2] no port flap during S0 (device driver enabled/active) to S5 shutdown w/ NCSI enabled
        
Version 15.0.0.2  Apr 25, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ54972: DTM testing gets stuck at VMQStressTest of NIDSTest6.5 
      Cause:
        There is an coding error in the logic for CQ51637 workaround that makes NBLs pending in miniport 
        driver and it makes ndistest protocol driver keep waiting for driver to complete the packet. 
      Change:
        Correct the logic to make driver complete the NBL successfully.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 15.0.0.1  Apr 21, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ54928: Driver stuck when unloading driver with VMQ enable + key *RssOrVmqPreference=1 
      Cause:
        When making NDISTest6.5 (in WLK1.5 or WLK1.6), user needs to add the registry *RssOrVmqPreference 
        manually before testing. This creates a corner case that make driver think VMQ is enabled, however 
        VMQ number is zero. This make driver's CQ51637 workaround no able to process send event anymore, 
        so it causes driver is unable to be unloaded because OS think there is pending NBL inside driver.
      Change:
        Make code change to process the corner case (VMQ enabled + zero VMQ number) properly.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 15.0.0.0A  Apr 20, 2011
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Limit 5719 Send BD size to 4K or less.
      Change:
        When the tx packet size is larger than 4K, driver will split the packet into 
        multiple SBDs with size less or equal to 4K.
      Impact:
        The change applies only for 5719.


Version 15.0.0.0  Apr 19, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ54261 - The ping delay can be seen with 14.6 gold driver on OEM platform.
      Change:
        Modify interrupt coalescing parameter by setting "RxMaxCoalescedFramesDuringInt" to 0 for OEM systems.
      Impact:
        None.
  
  2.  Problem:
        CQ54559 - Rx discards stat increments when dropping undesirable multicast frames.
      Cause:
        The counter increments because multicast frames are being rejected by the APE, 
        which increases the counter.
      Change:
        Implement an alternative strategy where the driver counts the number of times 
        rx mbuf resources are unavailable.
      Impact:
        The workaround grossly approximates the original function of the counter, 
        but not exactly. This bug only affects 5717/5718, 5719 A0, and 5720 A0.
 
  3.  Problem:
        The link flap happened on a third party EEE capable switch.
      Cause:
        A software workaround for EEE PHY interoperability issue is not right.
      Change:
        Modified the software workaround for EEE PHY interoperability issue.		 
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ51637 - Network traffic on GOS will fail after running CC32 on all pass-thru paths.
      Cause:
        The failed symptom shows that Guest OS doesn't pass tx packet to driver for sending out anymore.
      Change:
        Check and indicate TX completion periodically in driver's timer function.
      Impact:
        The workaround applies to TSS capable devices only (ex. 5719/5720).
  
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ54443,CQ54540 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ54485 - NCSI NX1: Pass-thru only works 1G link when OS present with playdead mode
      Change:
        Make driver not to change MAC Port Mode (bit [3:2] of reg 0x400) when device is in playdead mode.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request:
        Apply CQ54261 fix to a specific OEM 4 part ID.
      Change:
        By Inf files.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Request:

Version 14.8.0.2  Mar 04, 2011
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ52856 - Cotopaxi-A0: Running chariot with BASP teaming and Hyper-V on Host will cause BSOD
      Cause:
        When a NIC is added to a virtual network for VMs, OS will set *RssOrVmqPreference to tell 
        the driver RSS is not used even when VMQ is disable. However, when b57 driver is used by BASP 
        teaming and BASP is added to a virtual network, the key is set for BASP but not for b57 
        driver. So the b57 driver still think the RSS is enable. Plus RSS hash info is still passed on NBLs 
        which is used by TSS and cause the problem. 
      Change:
        Disable TSS if RSS table size is 0.

        In this bootcode, it speeds up the loading of the Phase1 & Phase 2 bootcode by setting bit 31 of 
        register 3624 to 1 to force the CPMU to speed up the core clock to 62.5MHz when the internal cpu 
        gets reset and Vmain_Present is high. For the power saving, driver needs to to clear bit 31 of 
        register 3624 to 0 when it get loaded.
      Impact:
        None.

      Cause:
        Driver doesn't set consistent value to Receive MTU Size Reg (0x43c) and MAX_Frame_Size (located in RCB
        for Std Ring Reg 0x2458). The MTU Reg is used by EMAC to determine if device is going to receive or drop 
        the packet. Max Frame Size is used for device to determine if the packet goes to standard ring or jumbo
        ring (by WDMA). For this particular case, ¡§ping xxxx ¡Vl 1473¡¨ will actually generate a packet with length
        1519 (1473 + 42 header + 4 CRC). This packet will be received by device, but device is unable to do WDMA 
        for this packet, because jumbo ring is not enabled. Then the packet makes device unable to receive packet
        anymore (even with standard size packet).
      Change:
        Make driver to set MAX_Frame_Size (in RCB for Std Ring 0x2458) correctly.

        for Sawtooth B0.
      Change:
        Check bit8 in reg 0x5b4 to determine the PHY selection.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ49644 - 5718: Binding a virtual network will cause BSOD
      Cause:
        Driver was using incorrect number for send rings when system has more than 16 CPUs.
      Change:
        Limit the maximum send ring's number to 16.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CQ49979 - Bootcode: PM offload - doesn't respond MAC address 
		when PM-offload enabled with otp.
      Cause:
		The PM Offload firmware is expecting the Tx Mbuf headers to be initialize. 
		This is done by the bootcode but not done by OTP or SB.
      Change:
	    Tx Mbuf headers is initialized by PM Offload firmware(v1.12). 
		And driver doesn't need to clean up Tx Mbuf for PM offload.
      Impact:
        None.

  1.  Problem:
        CQ49528 - NDIStest6.5 MPE gets BSOD with bugcheck 0x9F
      Cause:
        Driver was getting *obsolete* Rx Std BD Consume Index from status block #0 while 
	collecting Rx packets from Rx Std Ring, when there were some packets received 
	in Rx Ret Ring #1 - #4 and device was generating status block #1-#4 update for
        incoming packets.
      Change:
        Move CQ42690 fix into Tigon3_DisableAllStateMachines() as a robust solution.
      Impact:

      Change:
        Change code to setup the ring size correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ45594 - Sawtooth - Power Util. does not come down after runing traffic with EEE enabled
      Cause:
	    When bit6 is set in EeeMode(0x36b0) register, NIC send producer ring index gets corrupted
		which prevent the chip going into EEE mode.
      Change:
		Don't set bit6 in EeeMode(0x36b0) register
      Impact:
        None.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ49169 - 5718: Unable to pass ping traffic after initial driver install.
      Cause:
        OS doesn't handle affinity for MSI-X interrupt properly, device MSI-X interrupt is asserted on the wrong
        CPU and this makes driver doesn't service interupt for Rx RSS correctly. It happens only when driver
        is uninstalled and then installed. It doesn't happen with driver is disabled and then enabled.
      Change:
        Set affinity policy for interrupt in inf file to make OS handle affinity for interrupt correctly.
      Impact:
        None.  

  2.  Problem:
        CQ49529 - 5718 fiber: System is unable to wake up with all WOL modes.
      Cause:
        Driver incorrectly configures PHY for enabling Ethernet@WireSpeed when serdes interface is used.
        This makes device lose link while system entering S3/S4/S5.
      Change:
        Make driver does not apply Ethernet@WireSpeed code when serdes interface is used.
      Impact:
        None.  

  3.  Problem:
        A NS Multicast Ethernet packet test in WLK 1.6 KeepAlive tests failed.

Version 14.2.0.5  May 21, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ47563 - After resuming from S3, enabled/disable DASH fw through bmcc command cause SUT system abnormal.
      Cause:
        Driver is not aware that DASH is enabled/disabled at runtime, so driver can't make APE status update for
        correct driver state.
      Change:
        Implement new change for driver make APE status update for driver state change. Also, driver needs BMAPI
        (v7.19.0 and after) to suspend/resume driver after DASH has been enabled/disabled, then driver will have
        chance to reread NIC configuration (shared memory 0xb58 bit_7) for determining if DASH is enabled or not.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ47596 - Rel14.2:NXI:Sawtooth:bcm5718 failed on NDISTest VMQ test in W2K8 R2 x64
      Change:
        Don't return MSIXTableEntry when a VMQ is created even the spec say so and add
        OID_RECEIVE_FILTER_QUEUE_PARAMETERS support in NdisRequestSetInformation.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ47597 - Rel14.2:Sawtooth:bcm5718 failed on addresschange test in W2K8 R2 x64.
      Cause:
        The Mac Address was not changed when VMQ was enable.
      Change:
        Allow Mac address update and overwrite MMA mode when VMQ is enable.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ47591 - Rel14.2:Sawtooth:bcm5718 failed on glitchfreedevice test in W2K8 R2 x64.
      Cause:
        The failure was happened only if VMQ was enabled because RST was not supported by VMQ.
      Change:
        Add RST support on VMQ.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Support Sawtooth APE NCSI.
  2.  Request:
        Add Sawtooth TSS support.


Version 14.2.0.4  Apr 30, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ47185 - Sawtooth: Unable running 16proc when VMQ enable with  Windows 2008 R2 Datacenter
      Cause:
        Default VMQ processors number for 1G is 8.
      Change:
        Add and set *MaxRssProcessors keyword to 16 in the inf file for VMQ to use 16 proc.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ47248 - Dash/ASF packets wakes up the system when XP enables WOL in the OS
      Change:
        Pass the WOL patterns to DASH firmware and let DASH firmware to handle WOL.
      Impact:
        Need to use DASH firmware V1.42.0.0 or later version.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ46602 - 57765 traffic broken when running chariot TX at 100M with jumbo enabled
      Cause:
        A control bit to enable/disable the Hw fix for CQ12429 is unexpectedly cleared by driver.
      Change:
        Enable the control bit back for fixing TxMBUF Lockup issue.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        WMI event notification for 5761 DASH firmware.
      Change:
        The request is to enable immediate graceful power control and other remote management features in 5761.
        The DASH firmware will generate an interrupt to the host. The driver will not be able to tell from the
        status block that the interrupt is from the DASH firmware. So as part of the interrupt handling the
        driver will need to query register 0x6810 (RX CPU Event). If bit 0 (SW Event 0) is set then the driver
        will generate an WMI Event. Afterwards the driver will need to zero out this bit.
      Impact:
        The change works with 5761 with DASH firmware v1.42 or later.
  2.  Request:
        Fine tune dynamic VMQ HC.


Version 14.2.0.3  Apr 09, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        The "Last Driver State" (shared memory 0xC04) is incorrect when driver is unloaded with no WOL.
      Change:
        Fix the code error to make driver report correct state when it's unloaded.
      Impact:
        None.
  2.  Problem:
        CQ46757 - Sawtooth: VMQ enabled and Chariots test on 8 GOS will only show two CPU running
      Cause:
        A VLan filtering flag check was not needed for MSFT VMQ WLK1.5 and was removed.
      Change:
        Put back the vlan filtering flag check which is needed for VMQs.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ46755 - Sawtooth: System hangs when enabled VMQ VLAN Filtering from Device Manager with Chariots test
      Change:
        Fixed a bug in the code that supported multi-vmq per vector.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ46641 - Vista x64 gets BSOD after resuming from S4.
      Cause:
        After resuming from S4, the Receive Return Ring Produce Index read form host memory is incorrect,
        this makes driver access to wrong Rx Buffer Descriptor and touch invalid memory address for buffer data.
      Change:
        Initialize all Receive Return Prod Indexes (of MSI-X status block) to 0 while reseting device.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add the following changes in driver in order to support customer who uses OTP implementation.
        1) Driver needs to set bit 31 in register PCIE Physical Layer Register 0x1814 to disable clkreq in L2 to
           workaround a chipset bug.
        2) Driver needs to clear bits [9:7] of PCIE Configuration Space in Function 0 Register 0x6C.
           This is needed to ensure the SD Host Controller does not lock up.
        3) LAN Driver needs to force the Core Clock to 6.25MHz when the Ethernet Link is in 10Mb mode.
           This is needed in order to workaround a Hardware synchronization issue in the DMA Read Engine to
           prevent Fatal Error from stopping the transmitting logic.
      Note: the changes are for 57765/57785 family devices only


Version 14.2.0.2  Apr 02, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ46628 - WinFwUpg is unable to upgrade bootcode for 5718.
      Cause:
        Driver is not using the correct nvram strapping for recognizing the flash devices.
      Change:
        Update the nvram strapping map for the flash devices used by 5718.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44978 - Use *ReceiveBuffers registry key for NDIS6.x and NDIS5.x driver.
      Change:
        Replace the registry keys with MSFT definition keys.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ46736 - remove fix for CQ39683, CQ40054 from Windows drivers (ndis5, Ndis6)
      Change:
        Make changes as request. These fixes may cause PCIE Serdes corruptions that result in
        device disappearances when the system resumes from S4 (CQ46606). These fixes are
        removed from driver and added into OTP selfboot.
      Impact:
        It's for 57780/57760 family devices only.


Version 14.2.0.1  Mar 10, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45486 - 5718: observe a periodical spike when running chariot TX with LSO Disabled
      Cause:
        Driver was unable to switch the interrupt coalescing paramter set (from default to alternate) successfully.
        The alternate set of parameters is intended to make device generate certain numbers of interrupts per second
        under heavy traffic. With unsuccessful switch and driver's dynamic interrupt coalescing enabled, driver stays
        with default parameters set and driver will try to do interrupt coalescing setting switch every 60 seconds
        when device's interrupt rate is high. This causes throughput to drop a little bit and user will see the
        periodical spike in chariot graph.
      Change:
        Fine-tune Tx interrupt coalescing parameter (with MSI-X/RSS enabled and LSO disbaled) to make driver switch to
        and stay with alternate interrupt coalescing parameter set successfully.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ45808 - VMQ: X64_0x3B_VRF_b57nd60a+4124a running NDISTest6.5 vmqstresstest
      Cause:
        Since Sawtooth can only set one HDS LookaheadSize. There was an assertion if two VMQs had different
        LookaheadSize.
      Change:
        Dynamically update the HDS LookaheadSize and always allocate Lookahead buffer to the max LookaheadSize for
        VMQ rx buffers. There are also many changes for MSFT WLK 1.5 VMQ tests.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Enable Sawtooth bit16, 17, 18 in reg 0x70 for bmapi diag tests.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 14.2.0.0  Feb 25, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45854 - BrcmMgmtAgent causing audio glitch during audio playout.
      Cause:
        The read/write NVRAM OIDs acquired a spin lock which made them run on irq dispatch level.
      Change:
        Remove the unnecessary spin lock for these OIDs.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ46066 - 5721:watch dog timer time out when the OS deploy job which is running where setup
        is restarting the machine stating "setup will continue after restarting"
      Cause:
        A dpc come after the driver shut down.
      Change:
        Don't server the dpc after the driver shut down.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45484 - b57driver needs to add support for 5724.
      Change:
        The previous change in v14.0.0.6 is incomplete. Not only 2 parts IDs in inf files,
        Driver needs to make other changes to work with 5724.
        ex. Get ASIC revison from correct offset based on 5724's device ID.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Restore CQ45685, CQ46108 changes for 14.2 driver release
      Change:
        Make inf change as request.
      Note:
        CQ45685 - Remove EEE from driver advanced properties for the 14.0 Gold driver

        CQ46108 - Remove Sawtooth Support from 14.0 Driver
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.7  Feb 09, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ45796 - 57781/57765 no link after system resume from S1/S3 mode with SB code.
      Change:
        We have an issue in the SB ROM code which require a 10ms delay after seeing the
        reset signature (~KevT) in Shared Memory 0xB50 to workaround the issue.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.6  Feb 05, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
       CQ45244 - Link Flaps when EEE is enabled on SUT2, but not on SUT1
      Cause:
        Some bits in EeeMode reg are set by default
      Change:
       disabled all EEE related bits in EeeMode reg and clear PHY 1000TX/100Base-Tx EEE advertise
       for Sawtooth if EEE mode is not enable.

  2.  Problem:
       CQ45444 - Tx NQS is filtering packets when opcode does match for TCP Payloads.
      Cause:
       For element filter Element-Header 4 "Start of TCP/UDP Payload, else IP Payload, else Ethernet Payload",
       the current driver design will check on both TCP payload and IP payload and filter out the packet if
       any one of them matches.
      Change:
        Make driver's TX NQS filter works like device's RX NQS filter - when packet contains IP payload and TCP payload,
        driver will examine NQS filter against TCP or UDP payload only.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ45666 - 57765x-system hanged when run Diagnostic test at 100MF/100MH with ASF enabled
      Cause:
        During MAC loopback test in BACS diagnostic testing, there is a racing condition which causes
        driver to free a spin lock which is not acquired yet. The deadlock makes system hang.
      Change:
        Make code change to prevent driver running into the racing condition.
      Impact:
        None.
  4.  Problem:
        CQ45662 - ASPEN(BACS): Diagnostics tests are not suspended for Aspen/57761/57781 adapter .
      Cause:
        The rx standard consumer index from status block is not correct when the driver is suspended.
      Change:
        Force a status block update and stop the hardware to make driver get the most updated index.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45418 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.

      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.5  Jan 15, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       When upgrading to the EEE enabled driver. Going from version 14.0.0.4 to version 14.0.04A.
       We could see the EEE property, however both the disable and enable values were missing.
       After a system reboot, we could see them.
     Cause:
       OS can't stick on the default value of EEE property right after driver upgrade.
     Change:
       Add a workaround to force OS to stick with EEE default value after driver upgrade.

  2. Problem:
       CQ45268 - 5718: System will link at 1G when put system in S3/S4/S5 mode.
     Cause:
       The fix for CQ44614 has assigned real/correct GPHY ID for 5718 copper interface. However it has a falw
       which makes part of driver code (ex. LM_ForceAutoNegBcm540xPhy()) is not executed and it causes problem.
     Change:
       The driver code is executed with new 5718 GPHY ID for copper interface.
     Impact:
       None.

  3. Problem:
       CQ44927 - Sawtooth:TCP SYN v4/v6 can't wake up when PM offload enabled.
     Cause:
       The address of wake-up pattern has been moved to 0x24000 in Sawtooth.
     Change:
       Use the correct address of wake-up pattern for Sawtooth with PM offload firmware v1.07.
     Impact:
       None.

  4. Problem:
       CQ45152 - sawtooth: PLLpowerdown and CLKREQ.
     Cause:
       This is a A0 hardware issue that is Sawtooth does not allow PLLPowerdown in L1 to be enabled
       if CLKREQ is also enabled.
     Change:
       Workaround by if CLKREQ is not enabled, driver needs to enable device L1 PLLPowerdown.

  5.  Problem:
        Driver failed on DTM 1c_kernelcalls test
      Cause:
        Driver has incorrectly made a call to DbgBreakPoint() with free version driver.
      Change:
        Remove DbgBreakPoint() from free version driver.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ45261 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ45271 - Disable gigabit capability for specific OEM platform.
      Change:
        Make inf changes as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request
        CQ45290 - Update Product_Version String to 15.0.0 for Release 14.0.
      Change:
        Change the product version as required.

        None.

  4.  Request
        57765/57785 "DMA Read/Write Control Register" access (offset 0x6C)
      Change:
        Make change for driver to program bit 21:19 for "DMA Write WaterMark" only.
        For other bits, let bootcode to control it.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Request:
        Change the Copyright information to include 2010 for all SW modules
      Change:
        Change the Copyright information to include 2010 in related files.


Version 14.0.0.4A  Jan 11, 2010
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Add an advanced property entry to enable EEE for 5717/5718/57765/57785 family devices,
        and have the setting default to disabled.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.4  Jan 08, 2010
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ45036 - NDIS Driver 14.0.0.3: BACScli run diagnostic and cable analysis test failed.
     Cause:
       The fix of CQ43457 has a bug which doesn't detect pending number of
       indicated rx packets correctly.
     Change:
       The count in IoRef struct should be 2 instead of 1 without pending
       indicated rx packet.
     Impact:
        None.

  2. Problem:
       CQ45009 - Bacscli: BSOD occurs wihle performing PHY loopback on 5704 with latest driver.
     Cause:
       During continuous PHY loopback test, Bacscli will pass T3_OID_SET_LINE_SETTINGS to make driver setup
       GPHY for loopback mode or normal mode repeatedly. In some particular condition, Bacscli may pass the
       OID to driver for starting PHY loopback test while driver is still servicing the Link Change interrupt
       for the normal mode requested by Bacscli last time. This makes driver to free up a spinlock which is not
       acquired yet, and it makes system BSOD.
     Change:
       Adding a delay in driver before servicing T3_OID_SET_LINE_SETTINGS to let driver finish the DPC for
       servicing the link change interupt.
     Impact:
        None.

  3. Problem:
       CQ45090 - System gets BSOD (bugcheck 0x7C) while changing speed/duplex to 100M-auto under EEE.
     Cause:
       The timer for EEE function to assert LPI (Low Power Idle) is fired due to the link up/down
       event while driver is going to halt.
     Change:
       Cancel the EEE timer when driver is unloaded.
     Impact:
         None.

  4. Problem:
       CQ44614 - 5718 Fiber: Flow Control does not work when set to "Auto" in W2K8sp2.
     Cause:
       Driver is not using correct PHY address for accessing Serdes GPHY. It makes device unable to get
       correct Flow Control setting of link partner while doing Auto-Negotiation.
     Change:
       Use the correct PHY address while driver is accessing Serdes GPHY.
     Impact:
       None.

  5. Problem:
       CQ45110 - The interrupt/sec counter does not go down noticealby with interrupt moderation enabled.
     Cause:
       Driver is still using default interrupt coalescing settings when interrupt moderation is disabled.
       With interrupt moderation enabled, driver has an implementation for dynamic interrupt coalescing
       which will switch the interrupt coalescing settings from default to alternate when traffic is busy.
       So under some conditions, driver will stay with default settings with interrupt moderation enabled.
       This makes the interrupt number look the same when interrupt moderations is disabled.
     Change:
       Disable interrupt coalescing completely when interrupt moderation is disabled.
     Impact:
       None.

  6. Problem:
       CQ45051 - 5718/57765: Running 1 session cc32 is sluggish.
     Change:
       Adjust default interrupt coalescing setting to improve the performance.
     Impact:
       None.

  7. Problem:
       CQ45129 - 57765 : Glitchfreedevice test (in WLK NDISTest6.5) failed on Win2K8R2 x64 with MSI-X enabled
     Cause:
       Driver doesn't pass RST (Receive Side Throttle) parameter while calling UM_Dpc() from UM_DpcMsi() when MSI-X
       is enabled. This makes driver's function for indicating Rx packets is not aware that RST is enabled and it
       indicates all packets it has received and causes test failed.
     Change:
       Fix the error to make sure RST paramter is passed to UM_Dpc().
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1. Request:
       EEE LPI is enable only if EEE PHY negotiation success.
     Impact:
       The change is for 57765/57785 and 5717/5718 family devices only.

  2. Request:
       Add GPHY Green Mode support for 5717/5718/57765/57785 family devices.
     Change:
       Whenever link is at 1G and cable length is less than 10m, driver
       will enable device GPHY Green Mode for saving power.


Version 14.0.0.3  Dec 18, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ44534 - Sawtooth: Need to add ARP/NS offload support
     Cause:
       5718's ARP/NS offload support was missed in the b57nd60a.inf file.
     Change:
       5718's ARP/NS offload support is added in the b57nd60a.inf file.
     Impact:
        None.
  2. Problem:
       CQ43457 - specific OEM Management Port w/ NX1 controllers hangs and panics system during SW upgrade
     Cause:
       The driver can't be suspended after firmware upgrade because some rx packets never return back to
       the driver and causes specific OEM's heart beat timer timeout.
     Change:
       Return failure status for this case.
     Impact:
        Cause FW upgrade program return non-zero exit code.

  3. Problem:
       CQ44866 - 5718: The link speed is 100M when put system to S5 mode with NVRAM WOL enabled.
     Cause:
       The link speed should be 10M while system is in S5 with WOL speed set to LSA. However, the
       additional power-switching operation added for CQ44688 fix in the device reset routine has
       caused an unexpected reset after Vmain has been removed when system is in S5.
     Change:
       Remove the unnecessary power-switching in the driver reset rountine.
     Impact:
       It's for NIC design type only not for LOM.

  4. Problem:
       CQ44894 - Switch Flow control doesn't work correctly while system boots into OS
     Cause:
       Driver doesn't do GPHY Auto-Negotiation while it's loaded with cable connected. This makes switch
       (with pause frame setting = AUTO) unable to determine device's pause frame ability when link is up.
     Change:
       Make driver to do GPHY Auto-Negotiation while it's loaded with cable connected.
     Impact:
       None.

  5. Problem:
       CQ44864 - NDISTest6.5 (WLK1.5) fails with glitchfreedevice test on BCM5787M under Win7 x86
     Cause:
       Driver has an optimization code in DPC for handling rx packets which it will contine to check in a loop
       to see if there is new incoming rx packet. If there is any new packet coming in, it will continue to
       indicate rx packets to upper layer. This makes driver indicate packets over the number (per DPC)
       specified by the RST (Receive Side Throttle) parameters.
     Change:
       Disable the optimization code while RST is enabled/running.
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44826 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Enhanced change for EEE function to prevent link drop during heavy traffic.
      Impact:
        The change is for 57765/57785 and 5717/5718 family devices only.


Version 14.0.0.2  Dec 05, 2009
------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ44688 - Device doesn't switch from Vaux to Vmain while either port is enabled from both ports are diabled.
     Cause:
       Driver doesn't switch device power source from Vaux to Vmain while device is disabled and then enabled.
     Change:
       Make sure device is on Vmain whenever driver is loaded.
     Impact:
       It's for NIC design type only not for LOM.

  2. Problem:
       CQ44702 - The link speed is 100M after system entering S1/S3/S4 mode while Power Management is disabled.
     Cause:
       The bootcode set the link speed at 100M when Vmain goes away is due to the wol enable bit is set in
       the NVRAM. The bootcode will honor the wol enable bit in nvram is due to no wol_signature in shared
       memory offset 0xd30.
     Change:
       Make driver to setup wol signature correctly when wol function is enabled.
     Impact:
       None

  3. Problem:
       CQ44692 - Sawtooth: Hyperv-VMQ: BSOD with 7E while assign 8 different VALN ID to GOSes.
     Cause:
       It was caused by the assertion of not supporting vlan filter on vmq default queue.
     Change:
       Add vmq vlan filter support for default queue.
     Impact:
       None

  4. Problem:
       CQ42316 - During Factory X64 download, Active directory scripts are not downloading.
     Cause:
       The Netlongon service starts before network is ready. The reason why netowrk is not ready is due to
       an additional GPHY reset added during code merge for 5785, this extra GPHY reset makes device take
       longer time to link up while driver is loaded.
     Change:
       Make the GPHY reset for 5785 only, not for other devices.
     Impact:
       None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Adding support for 57765/57785 ASIC GPHY ID.
      Change:
        GPHY MII reg 0x2 = 0x0362, GPHY MII reg 0x3 = 0x5e40.
      Impact:
        None.
  2.  Enable PM offload for Sawtooth.
  3.  Support EEE PHY.


Version 14.0.0.1  Nov 27, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ44600 - System gets BSOD when run no link load/unload on 5718 Fiber port 2.
      Cause:
        The bugcheck code (7c) shows that there is a timer event fired after driver is halted.
        It is related to timer "AutonegRetryTimer" driver uses for Fiber interface only.
      Change:
        Prevent driver from scheduling new timer event when driver is halted.
      Note:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ44650 - 5718: WOL fail to wake from S3(Standby) and S4 (Hibernate) using Ping.
      Cause:
        The wake up patterns are not programmed correctly for 5718.
      Change:
        Correct the error to make sure the patterns are saved in the correct place.
      Note:
        None

  3. Problem:
       CQ44586 - 5718: System halt (BSOD) while installing driver on specific OEM system.
     Cause:
       Driver (for 64-bit OS) will generate 2 DWORD Memory Write while accessing APE Host Registers.
       However, device does not support Memory Write with 2 DWORD. So device will generate
       ERROR_NONFATAL message to rootcomplex and set bit_15 (Completer Abort Status) of
       Uncorrectable Error Status Register (0x104).
     Change:
       Prevent driver from generating 2 DWORD Memory Write while working with 64-bit OS.
     Impact:
       None

  4. Problem:
       CQ44443 - 5718: When system enters S3, device gets link at 100Mbps while doing WOL negative test.
     Cause:
       Driver for dual ports NIC design needs to make handshake before doing power-switching, only one driver
       instance needs to do the power switching. The current driver code will make twice power switching for NIC,
       this causes an unexpected reset after Vmain is removed. Then bootcode will be reloaded and configure
       link speed to 100Mbps instead of powering the device with no link (when WOL is not needed).
     Change:
       Make driver to handle power-switching for device with NIC design properly (by using APE Ctrl register
       0x08 bits[19:2] for dual-port message exchange).
     Impact:
       None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44669 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.


Version 14.0.0.0  Nov 19, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ44266 - 5761 (with DASH enabled) has low chariot thruput result under WinXP.
      Cause:
        The code for NQS (Network Quarantine Service) is incorrectly executed while NQS
        is disabled in DASH.
      Change:
        Make driver to check if NQS is enabled or not before running the code for NQS.
      Note:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44349, CQ44542 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ44417 - Remove OID_GEN_MEDIA_DUPLEX_STATE code from NX1 NDIS driver
      Change:
        Remove OID_GEN_MEDIA_DUPLEX_STATE from driver's supported OIDs list.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request:
        Add support for 57765 family devices.
      Change:
        Merge code from the branch for 57765 family devices.

  4.  Request:
        Add support for 5717 family devices.
      Change:
        Merge code from the branch for 5717 family devices.


Version 12.4.0.2A  Oct 27, 2009
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44219 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.4.0.2 Oct 11, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        57760/57780 fails on FwCfg 1G loopback test.
      Cause:
        The GPHY Green Mode is enabled when device is linked at 1G speed and it causes
        FwCfg unable to receiving packets during loopback test.
      Change:
        Make driver not to enable GPHY Green Mode while making external loopback test.
      Note:
        None

   2.  Problem:
        CQ43851- Device disappears after multiple iterations of copy/compare test on specific OEM system.
      Cause:
        Due to design limitations, sometimes L1 exit transition does not cause the serdes pll to resume
        normal operation.  When this happens the LOM will not be able to response to PCIE transaction
        and may be removed from the PCIE enumeration tree.
      Change:
        Implement the workaround to disable Pll Powerdown in L1 by writting 0x7080 to register offset
        0x7d54 afer every chip reset.
      Note:
        It's for 57760/57780 family devices only.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ44014 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs

Version 12.4.0.1 Sep 28, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ43465 : Under network stress test in Windows 2008R2, the LOM will disconnect within 10 minutes.
      Cause:
        During ISR, NDIS 6.20 driver calls the NdisMQueueDpcEx function to schedule DPC calls on CPUs.
        Under rare condition (ex. the CPU serives the interrupt is very busy) and it causes the DPC
        (scheduled for another CPU) start to run immediately before the ISR finished, this messes driver's
        count for pending DPC and it causes the interrupt is not enabled anymore.
      Change:
        Move the code (calls to NdisMQueueDpcEx) to end of ISR to resolve the race condition.
      Note:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        WLK1.4 RTM : Plug and Play Driver Test BSOD in Win2k8 R2 IA64
      Cause:
        During PNP test, device will be removed and the memory space (bit_1 of reg 0x04) is cleared.
        When driver is trying to do register access through address (BAR + register offset), it causes system
        BSOD with bugcheck code 0x124.
      Change:
        Make driver not to touch any register after receiving "Surprise Removal" Event Notification from NDIS.
        Also make driver to de-register interrupt, cancel timers and free resources in MiniportHaltEx function.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ43619 - Update Product_Version String to 14.2.0 for Release 12.4.
      Change:

Version 12.4.0.0  Sep 10, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ43026 - b57vista: RSS function doesn't work when enabled.
      Cause:
        The structures NDIS_RECEIVE_SCALE_PARAMETERS (specifies the RSS parameters) are different between
        NDIS 6.20 and earilier then NDIS 6.20. The formats of indirection table are different as well.
        These make driver doesn't handle OID_GEN_RECEIVE_SCALE_PARAMETERS properly and the device RSS
        function is not configured correctly.
      Change:
        Modify driver code to handle the new structure correctly while compling with Win7 DDK.
      Note:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ42957 - NQS Transmit Filter does not filter IP Payload
      Change:
        Implement the change as request.
      Impact:

      Impact:
        None


Version 12.2.2.1  Aug 06, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       Win7 fails GlitchFreeDevice in Ndistest 6.5.
     Cause:
       The fix for CQ42470 introduced a code error that makes RST doesn't work properly.
     Change:
       Fix the code error.
     Impact:
       None.


Version 12.2.2.0A  Aug 04, 2009
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        Use standardized INF keywords for PM Offload descriptions.
      Change:
        Make inf changes to use "ARP offload" and "NS offload" accordingly.
      Impact:
        None


Version 12.2.2.0  July 31, 2009
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request
        CQ42903 - Update Product_Version String to 14.1.1 for Release 12.2a.
      Change:
        Change the product version as required.
      Impact:
        None


Version 12.2.0.5  Jul 27, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42211 - B57Driver is unable to filter packets with NQS (Network Quarantine Service).
      Cause:
        Driver is lack of NQS support.
      Change:
        Add NQS support in driver to filter out tx packet specified by DASH firmware.
      Note:
        The function needs to work with DASH v1.22.0.0 or after and it's for 5761 family devices only.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ42470 - System gets blue screen (with bugcheck D1) during sleep stress tests.
      Cause:
        When driver is processing RST in DPC and the value returned from NDIS marco "NDIS_CURRENT_PROCESSOR_NUMBER"
        is larger than RSS rings number, this will cause driver to unexpectedly assign NULL value to another member
        (called pRxJumboBdVirt) in driver's low device block structure. Then system gets BSOD when driver is running
         the code with pRxJumboBdVirt when system is resuming from Standby.
      Change:
        Ensure RstParam in driver's low device block is never accessed with a subscript that is too large.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ42667 - PM Offload doesn't work when it's enabled.
      Cause:
        IPv6 Neighbor Advertisement packet is broken with uninitialized TX Mbuf header field.
      Change:
        Make driver to zero out TxMBuf from 0x9E80-0x9FFF for PM Offload Firmware.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ42236 workaround - Driver needs to implement the following procedures before any GRC or CPU reset
        1. write 0x7d54 with 0x7080 (to disable l1 pll pwrdwn), then
        2. do a dummy read of 0x7d54 to flush the write, then
        3. issue GRC or CPU reset.
      Change:
        Make driver change as requested.
      Impact:
        It's for 57760/57780/57790 family devices only.

  2.  Request:
        CQ42769 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.2.0.4  Jul 13, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ42109 - Win7: 57780 can not do arp respone for a long time with PM offload enable.
      Cause:
        The RxMBuf memory size allocated for the CiLai PM Offload firmware to store its data
        was too small. The firmware data was overflowing into the RxMBuf area used for received
        packets thus causing a corruption of the firrmware data.
      Change:
        Increased RxMbuf memory used by the CiLai PM Offload firmware to store its data.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ42223 - Win7 - Flow Control Setting is disabled with the Gold 12.2 Driver.
      Cause:
        The inbox driver has disabled the settings per MSFT's request. When upgrading driver
        , the disabled settings persists, instead of changing to Auto.
      Change:
        Make inf change to delete the Flow Control setting and reset the setting to Auto.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ42247 - 5761(LOM) : PM offload dies after few iterations
      Cause:
        PM Offload firmware was locking/unlocking thw SW arbitration bit during initialization
        to access the NVRAM. Apparently there was some timing issue with the driver on OEM system
        during the downloading of the firrmware causing the SW arbitration bit to stay lock thus
        causing the firmware not to run.
      Change:
        Resolution is to remove access to NVRAM since firmware does not need any info from NVRAM.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ39683: Cilai detects Receiver Error when the Link Transition between L0s/L0
      Change:
        workaround: shorten the delay of the electrical idle signal from serdes
        a. write register 0x7e70 bit [4:0] with 0x0c during device initialization or device reset
        b. write all ones to register 0x110 (correctable error status).

  2.  Request:
        CQ40054: PLL power down common mode voltage glitch on Tx
      Change:
        workaround: use low-power transmitter mode during device initialization or device reset
        changed PCIe SerDes register values to the following
        a. Register 0x15 in block 0x8610 = 0x47b.
        b. Register 0x1A in block 0x8010 = 0x4038.

  3.  Request:
        CQ41813 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Request:
        Add Windows 7 Power Management Offload support for 57760/577805/7790
      Change:
        Support for this new feature is added in this driver version.
      Impact:
        The PM Offload firmware is now bound to the driver, so any update
        will require a driver spin moving forward. Also, PM Offload is not
        compatible with ASF, so will be disabled if ASF is enabled.

  5.  Request:
        CQ42216 - Update friendly name for OEM projects
      Change:
        Change device friendly name as request.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.2.0.3  May 28, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ41216 - Win7-NetBIOS name query cannot wake up system
      Cause:
        Driver doesn't set "end of wol comparison stream" correctly when pattern size is an odd numer.
      Change:
        Make driver to handle pattern size (odd number) correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
       CQ41352 - BCM5754M fails WOL on ICMP PING test
      Cause:
       When pattern size is less than 64 bytes and byte mask is less than 8 byte, driver will try to
       set "end of wol comparison pattern" at 64 bytes (the minimun ethernet packets) but it never happens.
       Without setting "end of wol comparison stream", device is unable to detect wol packet correctly.
      Change:
       Make driver to set "end of wol comparison pattern" correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Problem:
       CQ41284 - Win7-PM offload test failed -5705 failed to send arp response when system
                 stayed in sleep mode with PM Offload enabled.
       CQ41280 - Win7- TCP SYN v4 / v6 cannot wake up system, but it works fine when PM
                 offload is disabled.
      Cause:
       The 5705 has an errata which prohibits using the internal CPU instruction cache.
       There is some register contention between the driver and the PM Offload firmware
      Change:
       The firmware in this version disables the instruction cache.
       The driver is changed to load the PM Offload firmware only once power down chip
       setup is done.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
       CQ41583 - Win7 PM Offload (both ARP and NS) stops working after 3 responses
      Cause:
       The 5761 device was not configured properly for PM Offload.
      Change:
       Configured the device properly.
      Impact:
        None.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40338 - IPChecksumOffload Keyword missing in NDIS 6.0 driver.
      Change:
        Add the standardized registry key "*IPChecksumOffloadIPv4" in INF files as requested.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ41003 - System gets BSOD on NDISTest 6.0 - 1c_registry test
      Cause:
        During 1c_registry test, the registry key "RSSRxRing" is set with invalid value
        and this makes driver's RSS code can't work properly.
      Change:
        Adding boundary check to protect driver from using invalid registry key values.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Driver needs to disables L1 PLL power down when Ethernet link is 10 half duplex or 100 half duplex,
        in additional to disabling CLKREQ.
      Change:
        Set bit 7 (L1 PLL Powerdown Disable) of MAC register 0x7d54 for 10H and 100H.

  2.  Request:
        Initial RSS V2 support.


Version 12.2.0.1  May 04, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40782 - NDISTest6.5 (WoL and PM) failed on WolWin7Pattern test under Window 7.
      Cause:
        Driver is setting END of WOL stream according to (Mask Size * 8), instead of Pattern Length.
        When the wol pattern length is less than (Mask Size *8), device is unable to recognize
        the packet as a valid packet and it won't wake up system.
      Change
        Make driver to set END of WOL stream according to WOL pattern length.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ40735 - NX1-Need to add PM offload support Windows7's.
      Change:

      Change:
        Support for this new feature is added in this driver version.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.2.0.0  April 20, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40017 - DASH: does not show correct driver version in Software Inventory.
      Cause:
        There is a problem with the new 4-part NDIS driver versioning scheme (e.g. 12.0.0.5).
        The existing APE shared memory interface definition only supports 3-part driver version numbers (e.g. 12.0.0).
      Change:
        A new field has been created for an 8-bit driver build number (e.g. 12.0.0.n) to be supported.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ40241 - APE shared memory initialized/updated incorrectly on Vista-x64 and XP-64.
      Cause:
        Driver uses function RtlZeroMemory() to initialize APE shared memory while it
        is loaded. However, the function will make x64 OS to generate invalid "Memory Write"
        to device when the virtual address (mapped to device APE shared memory) is used as
        input address. Similiar issue happens when driver is trying to copy message data
        (eg. date/time) from application/BMAPI to APE shared memory using NdisMoveMemory().
      Change:
        Use other addressing method to make OS generate "Memory Write" with correct data
        while driver is trying to initialize/update device's APE shared memory.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CQ39984 - WinFWUPG (57760 with ATMLH742) after upgrade asf, run "crc" will get checksum failed.
      Cause:
        Driver does not handle eeprom page write correctly. When page write crosses the page boundary
        the data word address will roll over and the previous data will overwritten.
      Change:
        Make driver to handle eeprom page write properly so that eeprom is programmed correctly.
      Impact:
        None

  4.  Problem:
        CQ40503 - 5761/5761s: The LED shows Green in S5 mode when WOL speed set 10Mb and DASH enabled.
      Cause:
        Driver doesn't inform DASH firmware WOL speed correctly and this makes DASH set link
        speed to 10Mbps (eg. Lowest VAUX Link Speed setting in mancfg) when VMain is removed.
      Change:
        Driver to update DASH with correct WOL speed in driver's shutdown routine.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============

  1.  Request:
        CQ40309 - Change WoL Speed to default to LSA option for OEM Platforms
      Change:
        Make inf change as request.

        None

  2.  Request
        CQ40377 - For Release 12.2, Please Update Product_Version String for NDIS 5.1 and later Drivers to 14.1.0
      Change:
        Change the product version as required.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Request:
        Enhance OTP programming reliability.
      Change:
        Driver needs to implement the following steps whild doing OTP program.
        1) To use external clock for the programming.
        2) Try to reprogram OTP bit up to 16 times if the OTP is stuck at 0.
        3) Do OTP init command immediately after a OTP write.


Version 12.0.0.6  Mar 19, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40065 - Driver Load/Unload BDOD 0x50 on Vista.
      Change:
        Moved 5761 WOL speed processing to the driver's shutdown code path.
      Impact:
        None


Version 12.0.0.5  Mar 18, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ40001 - OEM is not able to enable Jumbo Frame on the 5715 devices via NCU
      Change:
        The application NCU is adding rxmtu registry key when the user enables Jumbo Frame.
        Driver needs to implement a workaround to accommodate the rxmtu key.
      Impact;
        None.

        None.


Version 12.0.0.3  Mar 09, 2009
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ39796 - doing boot code program in WinFWUpg will show error message.
      Cause:
        Driver has incorrect configuration values for EEPROM which makes driver treat EEPROM as a flash device.
        This make driver can't write correct data into EEPROM and cause checksum error.
      Change:
        Correct code error to make driver use correct configuration when EEPROM is used.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Do not write OTP bits if the bits have been set already.
      Change:
        Read data from OTP first and then compare the "orignal data" and "data to write",
        if the bits in "data to write" have set already, driver will skip the OTP write.
      Impact:
        None.

      Change:
        Make driver to skip CQ35234 workaround for specific OEM systems.
      Impact:
        Without CQ35234 workaround, 5784M/5764M may not assert Wake signal one the first Wake
        packet received. This happens when device is connected to some particular switches.

  4. Request:
        CQ39628 - Enhance advanced properties to allow the user to define the amount of 'RSS queues'
      Change:
        For NX1 RSS capable devices, an option in the driver advanced property will allow
        the user to change the amount of RSS queues in increments of the power of 2.
      Impact:
        None.

  5.  Request:
        CQ39839 - Change OEM's INF to hide LSO option for specific 5715 devices.
      Change:
        Add hidden registry key to disable LSO option in OEM inf files.
      Impact:
        None.

  6.  Request:
        CQ39523 - add  min/max/default option for Tx + Rx buffers
      Change:
        Create an advanced driver option that allows the end user to select three different
        options for the amount of Tx + Rx buffers based on 2 part ID's.
      Impact:
        The change is for NX1 PCI-E based Server chips only: 5721, 5722, 5723 and 5714/15

        CQ39140 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.


Version 12.0.0.0  Feb 02, 2009
----------------------------------------
  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ39100 - Disable L1 ASPM when the connection speed is 10M/100M bps for OEM specific systems.
      Change:
        When the link speed is 10M/100Mbps, driver will clear L1 ASPM bit in Link Control Register.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        CQ39285 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Request:
        Add support for Windows 7 Power Management Offload
      Change:
        Support for this new feature is added in this driver version.
      Impact:
        The PM Offload firmware is now bound to the driver, so any update
        will require a driver spin moving forward.
        Also, PM Offload is not compatible with ASF, so will be disabled
        if ASF is enabled.


Version 11.9.0.0  Dec 24, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ36053 - Windiag shows "Device failed to negotiate link after 15sec" during PHY reset test
      Cause:
        Some device may generate "Link Status Change" interrupt immediately after powering down GPHY.
        This causes driver to run LM_SetupPhy() in UM_DPC() for servicing GPHY interrupt, while the
        application may send another T3_OID_PHY_ON to driver for powering on GPHY. This causes two
        driver threads to access GPHY at the same time, and it may cause GPHY content programmed
        with incorrect value.
      Change:
        Disable interrupt before powering down GPHY.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ37900 - Link down issue on some OEM platforms.
      Cause:
        The driver did not always start a software timer used to establish link on devices
        equiped with a Serdes.
      Change:
        Always start this timer when appropriate.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        Remove a lock in HaltAdapter() which caused BSOD reported by MSFT.
      Cause:
        Driver was calling NdisMSleep() while holding a spin lock and this causes
        assertion failed: KeGetCurrentIrql() < DISPATCH_LEVEL
      Change:
        Make driver not to acquire a spin lock while calling NdisMSleep().

  4.  Problem:
        CQ38082 - 3rd Party Filter Driver with our NXI Device Causes Loss of Connectivity
      Cause:
        Some packets were being held by a filter driver.  There were insufficient packets
        available to have our batching logic send them to NDIS when received or to put newly
        free packets to the chip.
      Change:
        Added code to keep from running out of packets.  Also if Jumbo Frames are supported,
        do not batch packets to NDIS or the chip, but process them immediately.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ38142,CQ38351,CQ38505 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.
      Change:
        Added IDs
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Request:
        Add support for 57760 A1 device.
      Change:
        Make driver to keep all SW A0 workarounds for A1.

  3.  Request:
        Add GPHY Green Mode support for 57760.
      Change:
        Whenever link is at 1G and cable length is less than 10m, driver
        will enable device GPHY Green Mode for saving power.

  4.  Request:
        Suppress 5761 "PCI Simple Communication Controller" device's yellow bang.
      Change:
        Make inf change to hide device (Device ID=0x160A) from Device Manager.

  5.  Request:
        Failing to deallocate memory after call to NdisAllocateMemoryWithTagPriority in UM_Initialize.
      Change:
        Freeing the allocated memory (for pUmDevice) when UM_SetAdapterRegAttribute() return failure.

  6.  Request:
        Bypass IPSEC info in NBLs and the codes if IPSEC offload is not supported.
      Cause:
        Driver is trying to handle IPSEC NBL on 5780 which doesn't support ipsec offload and
        then it causes bugcheck (code 0xD1).
      Change:
        Add safe guard code to bypass IPSEC info in NBLs if device doesn't support IPSEC offload.


Version 11.8.0.0  Oct 24, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ37690 - System cannot transmit packets by file sharing under Windows2008.
      Cause:
        When system is sending packets with LSO and TCP/IP checksum offload enabled,
        the initial tcp checksum field of packets coming from upper layer is not correct.
        Driver has a workaround to initialze the tcp checksum field with zero value,
        but this workaround didn't apply on 5780.
      Changes:
        Apply the tcp checksum workaround on 5780.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ37690.

  2. Problem:
        CQ38035 - jumbo frame size is reported differently by 14 compared
        to actual value for 5703/5704
     Cause:
        Introduced while fixing CQ34267 and CQ33947
     Change:
        Backing out both above CQ fixes. The implementation before
        these changes was correct, and was also consitant
        with NXII. The RxMtu the driver exports excludes the
        Ethernet frame header.
     Impact:
        The Jumbo packet size observed on the wire will be larger than the
        user specified value by 14 bytes, which is the Ethernet header size.

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        CQ37512 - Wrong friendly name for 5787M device.
                - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.

        Adding support for 57760
      Change:
        Modify code to add support for 57760.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 11.7.1.0 September 29, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        BSOD is seen while running the cable diagnostics
      Cause:
        The driver is referencing a data structure which is not
        initialized for plain Vista (no service pack)
      Change:
        Restriced access to this data structure only when
        it has been initialized properly.
      Impact:
        None

Version 11.7.0.0 September 22, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:

      Cause:
        Driver doesn't configure IPsec offload capabilities correctly in
        NDIS_IPSEC_OFFLOAD_V2 structure when "ESP enabled" is selected.
      Change:
        Modify driver to report IPsec offload capabilities correctly.
      Impact:
        None
  2.  Problem:
        CQ37260 ?5785 should not be in b57 driver. It should be in k57.
      Cause:
        This device is in the b57 inf for development purposes only.
      Change:
        Remove this device from the b57 infs.
      Impact:
        None

  3.  Problem:
        CQ37241 - B57driver unable to modify OOB settings through BACS3
        or Bmcc.
      Cause:
        There was a bug in the driver NVRAM access routines.
      Change:
        Remove a coding error which could corrupt the NVRAM content.
      Impact:
        None

  4.  Problem:
        CQ37293 - Ndis 5.x and 6.0 driver should have product version key set
        to 12.8.0 in 11.7.
      Cause:
        Incorrect product version in the infs.
      Change:
        Corrected the infs.
      Impact:
        None

  5.  Problem:
        CQ37185 - b57win:There are a lot of error events in event viewer
        when loading the b57win driver.
      Cause:
        An intermittent hardware error is not handled correctly.
      Change:
        Handle the error properly.
      Impact:
        None

  Enhancements:
  =============
  1.  Request:
        Remove SHA_1 (IPSec authentication algorithm) support for 5761S/5761SE.
      Cause:
        SHA_1 algorithm is not required.
      Change:
        Make driver not advertise the support of SHA_1 algorithm.
      Impact:
        None

  2.  Request:
        CQ37321 - Add 4 part ID support for specific OEM.

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ37048 - There are a lot of error events in the system event log when loading the driver.
      Cause:
        Driver fails to obtain APE mutex w/ non-5761 devices and then writes an entry to system error log.
        However, the APE mutex is only available for 5761 and the function should apply to 5761 devices only.
      Change:
        Call the function to obtain APE mutex only for 5761 devices.
      Impact:
        None.

  Enhancements:

      Change:
        Make inf changes to not support IPSEC for 5761/5761E
      Impact:
        None.


Version 10.101.0.0  Aug 25, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ36482 - 5761E looses net work connectivity after resuming from S3:DTM test
      Cause:
        CQ31830 workaround has a bug that it doesn't restore CPMU LinkSpeed1000 register properly when system
        resuming from sleep. And this workaround was incorrectly applied to 5761/5671E B0 and it causes CQ36482.
      Change:
        CQ31830 workaround should be applied for 5761/5761E Ax only because 5761E B0 have already fixed CQ31830.
        Driver has removed CQ31830 workaround for 5761/5761E B0.
      Impact:
        None.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ36025 - NIC b5761m shows only 10Mbps speed when system boots from iSCSI boot with BootCode v3.57.
      Cause:
        Durinng iscsi boot, driver will do an additional chip resest in driver initialization.
        But driver does not wait for bootcode completing initialization and it continues to get eeprom info
        from shared memory. Then driver gets zero value from shared memory and this make driver assign wrong
        PhyId for 5761 GPHY and program 5761 GPHY incorrectly.
      Change:
        Make driver to wait until bootcode finishing initialization while doing additional chip reset.
      Impact:
        None.

        None

  2.  Problem:
        CQ35948: Bad TX performance BX630S2 W2K8
      Cause: The Tx code path runs out of credit on some of the processors, so aborts without
        sending anything. This is occuring because a software timer
        failed to schedule the DPC responsible for calculating this credit. The DPCs were not
        scheduled for more than 4 procs on x86 systems, and 8 procs on x64 systems.
        This driver version fixes this problem
      Impact:
        None

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        IPSec offload is still enabled for 5761 devices
      Cause:
        Driver still reports IPSec hardware capabilities during initialization.
      Change:
        More inf changes to make driver doesn't advertise IPSec suppport.
      Impact:
        IPsec offload is no longer available

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ35947 - B5764/B5761/B5784-When setting  WOL speed to 10mb system will be come unresponsive and lose link.
      Cause:
        The CQ35234 workaround is incorrectly executed when driver is loaded with WOL speed setting as 10mb.
        There is no problem when WOL speed is set to Lowest, Auto or 100mb.
      Change:
        Correct driver's abnormal behavior and make driver to apply the CQ35234 workaround precisely.
      Impact:

      Change:
        Make driver to disable device's clkreq when linked at 10H or 100H as a workaround.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35239.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ35234 - 5784M/5764M will not assert Wake signal one the first Wake magic packet received.
      Cause:
        When device is connected to particular switch with specific PHY at 1G bps, with wol speed
        set to lowest speed, driver will program GPHY to advertise 10M bps support and restart
        auto-negotiation while system is going from S0 to S3/S4/S5. In the meantime, 100tx or 1000t
        idle sent from the link partner can confuse the local 10M bps polarity state machine, which
        in turn can corrupt the first 10Mbps packet received.
      Change:
        Make driver workaround to reset link porlarity state machine and restart auto negotiation.
      Impact:

----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34764 - DASH - B5761-B0 failure to wake from an interesting packet and Magic
        packet when DASH enabled.
      Cause:
        DASH behaviors is different with ASF for WOL. So driver need to handle an interesting
        packet and magic packet like no ASF. Also there was a bug when restoring DASH setting
        after reset which caused WOL was not enable.
      Change:
        handling interesting packet and magic packet as no ASF for DASH. The boot code v3.53
        or later are required for this fix.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34764.

      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34764.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ35436 - add changes for cq35021 and cq35105 to 11.4 branch.
      Cause:
        The changes were made to the 11.0b branch for this OEM. The request is to propagate
        the same changes to the 11.4 (main) branch.
      Change:
        Inf changes made.
      Impact:
        None.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ35315 - WinFwUpg: Fail to upgrade iSCSI firmware in 5761E/5761..

Version 10.96.0.0  May 14, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34659- ndis6: Remove LSO option in driver property for 5703 and 5704
        but not on previous driver
      Cause:
        The NDIS6 driver does not implement LSO for these chips, so there is no need to have the
        option in the driver advanced property page
      Change:
        Removed the LSO option from the infs for these chips. This is the second
        attempt at solving this problem.
      Impact:
        None.

 2.  Problem:
        CQ35339 - B5761-NDIS6.0 driver upgrade and disable will blue screen with 10.95.0.0

      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35339.


Version 10.95.0.0  May 12, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ34962 - 5784/5764/5761 system compatibility issue on particular OEM system.
      Cause:
        When BIOS sets root-complex's and device's Max Payload Size (MPS) to 256 bytes,
        device's MPS will be incorrectly set to 128 by driver, then device will report
        ERROR_FATAL and stop DMA when it makes Memory Read and receives completion
        packets larger than 128 bytes.
      Change:
        Make driver to keep device MPS setting during initialization.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34962.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ35105 - INF Service section is incorrect for specific OEM system.
      Cause:
        There is a typo in INF Service section for one OEM system.
      Change:
        Make inf change to correct services section string.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35105.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ34822 - Network traffic drops after SUT wakes up from S3/S4 while WOL is disabled.
      Cause:
        The reason why device doesn't pass traffic after system resuming from S3 (with
        "Allow computer to turn off xxx" is unchecked) is because the upper layer doesn't use
        the OID_OFFLOAD_ENCAPSULATION OID to set the task offload encapsulation settings
        of an underlying miniport, and this makes our driver fails to send certain packets
        which need driver/device to take care of checksum offload tasks.
      Change:
        Make driver to cache/restore the OID_OFFLOAD_ENCAPSULATION parameters across suspend/resume.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34822.

  4.  Problem:
        CQ34959 - Modify NDIS 6.0 driver WoL behaviour when the "allow the computer to turn off
        the device to save power" box is unchecked
      Cause:
        When driver's halt handler is called, driver enables device magic packet wol function according
        to nvram wol setting.
      Change:
        Make driver to take advantage of a HaltAction flag in the halt handler, then driver can use this
        flag to determine the reason why it's Halt handler is called and behave accordingly.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ34959.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ34904 - B57Vista: DASH FW stops responding when the Windows driver is disabled
      Cause:
        The MacCtrl register is not programmed correctly when
        the driver transitions to S3/D3.
      Change:
        Program the MacCtrl correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

  6.  Problem:
        CQ35107 - In BACS enabling ASF and adjusting Speed&Duplex setting
        at the same will cause link loss
      Cause:
        The link detect timer was not restarted after BACS called
        T3_OID_DIAG_SUSPEND/T3_OID_DIAG_RESUME
      Change:
        Restart the link detect timer.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35107.

  7.  Problem:
        CQ35060-FJ - low chariot RX through is observed on the release 11.0b Vista amd64 driver,
        but not on previous driver
      Cause:
        The changes which caused low performance was only for 5788(NON-DAC) and there was a CQ35248
        for it. The LM_IsAsicBondId5788 define was not correct which caused 5786 saw the problem.
      Change:
        Correct LM_IsAsicBondId5788 define.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ35060.

  8.  Problem:
        CQ34659- ndis6: Remove LSO option in driver property for 5703 and 5704
        but not on previous driver
      Cause:
        The NDIS6 driver does not implement LSO for these chips, so there is no need to have the
        option in the driver advanced property page
      Change:
        Removed the LSO option from the infs for these chips.
      Impact:
        None.

  9.  Problem:
        CQ34743 - MTU size needs to be 4 bytes larger with Management FW enabled
      Cause:
        The MtuSize register needs to be programed with a value larger by 4 bytes.
        We need this change to allow the firmware to process max size VLAN packets
        while the driver is running.
      Change:
        Increased the MtuSize register by 4 bytes.
      Impact:
        No impact.

  10.  Problem:
        DASH processor stalls when the driver applies a GRC reset
        while the DASH processor is also accessing the GRC reset register
      Cause:
        A LSI bug is causing this behavior. This driver implements the LSI recommended workaround.
      Change:
        The workaround requires the driver to acquire a mutex register before issuing the GRC
        reset. The driver also waits 10us before releasing the mutex after the GRC reset
      Impact:
        DASH firmware 0.96 or later is required for this fix to work.

  11.  Problem:
        CQ35248 - OEM system has a RX performance issue w/ 32bit Vista driver v10.62.1.2.
      Cause:
        5788 does not support dual address cycles and it cannot transmit a 64-bit address to a target
        device. So driver has a workaround to allocate DMA buffers under 4G for 5788. However, the
        cache type driver using for memory allocation is incorrect and this causes performance drop.
      Change:
        Make driver to use correct cache type while doing memory allocation.
      Impact:
        Reseolve CQ35248.

  12.  Problem:
        CQ33869 - 5704C has poor performance in WinPE 2.0 in a system with > 4 cores
      Cause:
        There are some scenarios, we can be asked to send continuously without having a chance to
        cleaning up the transmitted queue hence we are running out of UM_PACKET.
      Change:
        Clean up the tx queue if we see no UM_PACKET in the send path if we see no UM_PACKET
        instead of giving up
      Impact:
        Reseolve CQ33869.

Version 10.78.0.0  February 26, 2008
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ33858 - Device loses connection while doing load/unload test.
      Cause:
        When driver is unloaded, driver does a GRC Reset. When the link doesn't come back
        immediately, CPMU will put MAC core clock into slower speed. This makes boot code
        to be reloaed and executed slower. This also makes driver exceed waiting loop.
        Finally, GPHY register corrupted because of driver and boot-code racing condition.
      Change:
        Change CPMU Clock Policy Registers to increase the Core Clock Speed before issue
        a GRC reset and restore these registers after boot code has completed initialization.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ33858.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ33947 - Change *JumboPacket default MTU size to 1514
      Cause:
        The OEM is requesting that we default our mtu size for *JumboPacket to 1514
        and not 1500. Note that our driver has already 'raised' the mtu size to 1514
        when it sees 1500
      Change:
        Made the corresponding inf change to raise the default to 1514.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ32554 - Need NX1 ia64 driver parameters to comply with MSFT standards for NDIS6

        There is a discrepancy between the MSFT and Broadcom naming convention as applied
        to the *FlowControl keyword.
      Change:
        Changed the BRCM naming convention to match the one MSFT mandates.


  4.  Problem:
        CQ32379 - Add 4 ID checking for new HP_BCS ia64 platforms
      Cause:
        Add new OEM ID to the IA64 infs.

      Cause:
        System hung while driver was trying to acquire a spin lock in UM_CheckForHang(). Driver was
        making two continuous main lock acquisitions. The first one came from UM_QueryInformation(),
        when BACS passed T3_OID_DIAG_SUSPEND to driver during the test. The second one came from
        UM_CheckForHang(), which was called by NDIS every two seconds.
      Change:
        Make driver doesn't acquire main lock in UM_CheckForHang while cable analysis is still running.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32886 issue.

  4.  Problem:

      Cause:
        The WMI method that ndistest is using does NOT return any class derived from Win32_PerfRawData class.
        It only returns ¡§normal¡¨ WMI classes. However, the WMI class we provided is derived from Win32_PerfRawData
        class and it's used for graphing driver data to perfmon.exe along with some OS's provided perf data.
      Change:
        Create a registry key to control driiver to enable/disable WMI perf counts.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ30850 issue.

        Disable WDMA Rx Accel mode to workaround this issue.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32573 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ32692 - BSOD in Vista with driver while running common scenario stress
      Cause:
        Driver incorrectly cleans 5764M RX return ring producer index during system suspend/resume
        from sleep. This makes driver get stuck when OS is trying put system into sleep again.
        While OS is telling driver to put device into D3, driver can't complete IRP (IRP_MJ_POWER
        / IRP_MN_SET_POWER) and this causes system BSOD with Bug check - DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE.
      Change:
        Make driver to behave correctly - not clean 5764M RX return ring producer index during
        system suspend/resume from sleep.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32692.

  3.  Problem:
        CQ33072 - NDIS6 driver fails infTest in WLK 1.1

  4.  Problem:
        CQ33122 - NDIS6 driver fails 2c_mini6rsssendrecv in Ndistest 6.0 of WLK 1.1
      Cause:
        There is a logical error in code and it makes driver can't disable RSS as ndistest
        expected while doing RSS disabling test with zero "Hash Function Information" and
        non-zero "Indirection Table Size".
      Change:
        Correct the logical error to make driver disable device RSS function successfully.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ33122.

  5.  Problem:
        CQ32886 - Ndis6: SUT locks up when running cable analysis test while passing chariot traffic
      Cause:
        NDIS may returns rx packets later under heavy traffic and driver will still insert the returned
        packets into rx producer ring after state machines have been halted. This make driver falsely
        think it's missing some rx packets and make driver fall into a waiting loop. Besides, this also
        causes driver to mess up it's rx producer index.
      Change:
        Collect rx packets from producer ring and insert them back to rx free list.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ32886.

Version 10.60  August 30, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem
        CQ28879 - The issue manifests itself as a non-maskable interrupt (NMI)
        blue screen during system reboot.
      Cause:
        In vista, TCP could make call into the miniport
        after driver's shutdown routine had been called (as a result of shutting
        down the system) in certain edge cases. This happens if a TCP internal
        timer expired after (or at about the same time) the driver's shutdown
        got called.
      Change:
        Changed the driver's OID handler to detect if it's safe to touch the
        hardware by taking into the shutdown state into account.

      Value for 1 Gb Full Setting

      Cause:
      Non-contigious values in NDIS6 implementation

      Fix:
      Changed three '5's to '6' in INF files


Version 10.47.0.0   August 20, 2007

---------------------------------
   1. Enhancement
      CQ29991 Allow selection of 1Gbps full duplex

      Cause:
         Change in mappings with NDIS 6 doesn't allow NDIS 5 implementation
         to work.

      Change:
         Changed all 8200 to 6 (1Gbps Full Duplex) in infs. Change driver to
         map NDIS 6 value of 6 to 8200 (0x2008), our internal value.


Version 10.46.0.0D   August 17, 2007

---------------------------------
   1. Bug fix

      CQ30935: Rx/Tx performance is low when testing in chariot setup with
      one/two/three endpoints on some OEM platforms

      Cause:
      Enabling RSS actually reduces performance in some scenario.
      This is seen for example during performance tests with only
      a few TCP connections. This is also seen on competing
      products.

      Change:
      The previous fix removed support for RSS completely for some
      platforms which is not desired. In this version, RSS is only
      disabled, and can be re-enabled if needed.

   2. Bug Fix

1. Enhancement
       CQ30670 - disable LowPower mode for a requested 4part ID, when WOL is
       disabled and ASF is not present.

      Cause:
        For the 5787M, when ASF is not present and WOL is disabled, on entering S3,
        driver will allow bootcode to put the LOM into IDDQ
        LowPower Mode.

          An OEM request that IDDQ LowPwr mode be disabled for one selected
          platform.

      Cause:  Trying to allocate 640KB for LSO coalesce buffers can fail and
      retrying by reducing each attempt by 64KB will give the appearance that
      the system is not running properly.

      Change: Added code to determine amount of memory installed in the system
      and made available to Windows.  If the largest block exceeds 512MB,
      allow request to be for the full 640KB, otherwise only request 64KB.

Version 10.34.0.0 April 06, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ28745 - Phy Loopback failed in SR71 Blade Server 5906m LOM when
        cable is not present
      Cause:
        LM_SetupSnowLoopback() is resetting the PHY
        at the start of the loopback test. This reset was removed
        from the NDIS5.1 code base in the past, but not from the NDIS6
        code base.
      Change:
        Removed the spurious PHY reset in LM_SetupSnowLoopback().
      Impact:
        None.

   2. Problem:
        CQ28192 - Sending large pings leads to long round trip times on 5788.

      Impact:
        None.

   3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ28816 Add "L1 ASPM debounce" feature.
      Cause:
        There is an interoperability issue between the Broadcom
        LAN controllers and the Intel ICH7/8 that may cause the
        Rx-performance at 100 Mbps to be lower then expected when
        L1 ASPM is enabled along with system CPU C3E, or C4, or C4E
        or higher state.
      Change:
        Along with the device driver change here, that will drive
        the PCI-E link less aggressively into L1 ASPM during
        network stress, the user must enable the feature
        by setting a configurable option inside the LAN
        controllers NVRAM.
      Impact:
        There is no known impact from enabling this
        feature.  As a matter of fact, enabling this
        feature will increase the power savings in
        case the system has disabled 'L1 ASPM' due to
        the interoperability issue described above.


Version 10.33.0.0 March 07, 2007

   4. Problem:
        Fixed minor errors in implementing fix for CQ28493 and CQ28506.
      Cause:
        Wrong friendly name, and missing registry keys.
      Change:
        Fixed the friendly name (CQ28506), and added the requested
        registry key (CQ28493).
      Impact:
        None.

   5. Problem:
        CQ28458 - System hang when running BACS/Diagnostics Test
      Cause:
        There is a potential for a race condition to occur between the
        LAN controller's Interrupt Service Routine (ISR) and its
        scheduled Deferred Procedure Call (DPC) when running the Broadcom
        Diagnostics utility (BACS).  The affected code segment
        responsible for the problem is only executed when running BACS.
        Due to the fact that this issue requires a very specific timing
        between the ISR and the DPC this problem it is rather intermittent,
        or may not surface at all on particular systems.
        Nevertheless, when this condition occurs an ISR-storm gets triggered
        what will cause the LAN controller to saturate the system CPU and
        hang the system.
      Change:
        Modified specific code segments inside the device driver that
        get executed when running BACS in order to not enable interrupts
        inside the LAN controller twice what will prevent ISR-storms to occur.
      Impact:
        All BRCM chips are affected by the problem equally.  There are no
        known side effects from fixing this issue.

   6. Problem:
        5755/5756 Bugcheck D1 on LH Server with 8 or more CPUs if RSS is
        enabled.
      Cause:
        The driver doesn't always calculate the correct receive ring index
        in the case of system's number of CPUs is greater than the number of
        receive rings.
      Change:
        Modified specific code segments so that the driver can correctly
        calculate the receive ring number.
      Impact:
        There is no known side effect from fixing this issue.


Version 10.32 Feb 08, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ28412 - Low power mode in 5755M does not work under Vista.
      Cause:
        The Ndis driver was halting the embedded cpu when Wake Up Frame is enabled
        when the driver is being unloaded.
      Change:
        Modified the Ndis driver to only halt the embedded cpu when the system is
        transitioning to S3/S4 and Wake Up Frame is enabled.
      Impact:
        None.

   2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ28429 Add PCI 4 part Device ID to OEM specific
        INF installation files.

   2. Problem:
        When the ndis driver loads on a 5755M, 5787M or 5752M with the cable
        unplugged. The GPHY DLL was not being powered down.
      Cause:
        Corner case in the GPHY DLL power down code.
      Change:
        Corrected GPHY DLL power down code to properly handle the corner case.
      Impact:
        None.

   3. Problem:
        LH-6001 checked build assert.
      Cause:
        Corner case in the failure of allocating shared memory
        for coalescing pool.
      Change:
        Freed allocated resources when OS failed to return
        shared memory at initialization.
      Impact:
        None.

   4. Problem:
        PreFast warnings (DDK 6000).
      Cause:
        DDK 6000 introduces new PF warnings.
      Change:

Version 10.8b ** Inf Update Only ** January 9, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ#27306 - Adding WOL support for 5715S, for Tyan S3997,
        5715S A3.
      Cause:
        WakeOnTbi should be applied to BCM5714SWol install section.
      Change:
        Change the WOL option from ParamsWoL to ParamWakeOnTbi
        in the BCM5714SWol install section of the inf files.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.8a ** Inf Update Only ** January 8, 2007
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ28059 Missing friendly strings in inf file.
      Cause:
        Changes ported over from release 9.7 were not complete.
      Change:
        Added missing friendly strings into the inf file.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.8  December 18, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ27896 System CPU busy after finishing CPU test in BACS.
      Cause:
        The driver clears the status tag in host memory whem resuming
        the driver. This causes problem if MSI is active because
        MSI will not de-assert if the latest tag is not written
        to interrupt mailbox to ack the interrupt. The re-generated
        MSI interrupt doesn't associate with a status block update.
        One-shot MSI implemented on newer chips would solve this problem
        but it's not available to older PCIe chips.
      Change:
        Modify the driver not to clear the status tag after finishing
        diagnose.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.7  December 14, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ27776 5906 intermittently fails BACS Phy Loopback test.
      Cause:
        The 5906 phy auto-mdix feature needs to be disabled during phy
        loopback test.
      Change:
        Modified the ndis driver to disable auto-mdix during phy
        loopback on 5906.
      Impact:
        None.

   2. Problem:
        CQ27874 5906 -remove LSO support from sys and INF file
       (just like for 5906m)
      Cause:
        Refer to the CQ for more information
      Change:
        Modified the ndis driver and inf file to not report this
        feature to the operating system during ndis driver initialization.
      Impact:
        None.

   3. Problem:
        CQ27832 5755M failing IEEE compliance on certain OEM platforms.
      Cause:
        The phy trim registers needed to be modified by the ndis device driver.
      Change:
        Modified the ndis driver to program the phy trim registers per
        recommendation from phy engineering team.
      Impact:
        None.

   4. Problem:
        CQ#27795 remove "interrupt moderation" from
        "advanced driver properties" for OEM platforms.
      Cause:
        Refer to the CQ27795 for more information
      Change:
        For affected platforms, we want to hide the "interrupt moderation"
        option inside the driver advanced properties.
      Impact:
        None.


Version 10.6  December 8, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ27759 5906 fails WHQL packet filter test.
      Cause:
        The 5906 uses a different mechanism to filter broadcast
        packets from previous controllers.
      Change:
        Modified the ndis driver to properly filter broadcast packets
        on 5906.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.5  December 4, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ#27413 - implement restrictive AutoNeg in NDIS6 driver.
      Cause:
        The feature hasn't been populated from the NDIS5x driver because
        MSFT make the auto neg standardized keyword.
      Change:
        Modify driver translated non-standardized values to recognize
        restrictive auto negotiation settings.
      Impact:
        None.

   2. Problem:
        Low throughput performance on DosXX-5906M with ASPM enabled.
      Change:
        The low performance we are seeing is due to a design flaw
        in the ASIC. This flaw causes the PCI-e latency during DMA
        transfer to become unecessarily large, and leads to a lower
        throughput. The only way to get around this problem, is to
        coalesce every tx packets for the the 5906, which this Windows
        driver version does.
      Impact:
        Possibly higher CPU utilization with this version.

   3. Problem:
        Adding WOL support for 5715S, for Tyan S3997, 5715S A3
      Change:
        Added an entry for this device in the generic win32 and x64
        infs.
      Impact:
        None.

   4. Problem:
        CQ#27722 - new 4 part ID support for oem platforms.
      Change:
        INF update.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.4  November 27, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        CQ00027621 - Cannot Select Box to Allow AUT to wake up Computer
        in Pwr Mgmt Tab with NDIS 6 v10.3.
      Cause:
        In the v10.3 release, there is a requirement to remove certain
        advanced settings for some oem platforms, hence the driver's
        inf was changed to remove some registry settings before starting
        up the installation in order to clean up the registry keys.
        However, the OS installer seems to defer deleting registry at a
        point after these keys were re-populated back to the HKR location.
        Hence, the driver would not be able to read the settings.
      Change:
        Limited the keys to delete for the affected OEM platforms, only
        delete keys that are not used by the affected OEM platforms.
      Impact:
        None.

Version 10.3  November 22, 2006
----------------------------------------
   1. Problem:
        Need to clean up stale registry keys left by the inbox driver.
      Cause:
        For certain new devices, the inbox driver does generic 2-part
        matching during installation. For such new devices, the generic
        2-part installation section contains advanced features and settings
        which is not required by some OEMs for their new platforms. In these
        new platforms, 4-Part ID is used to specify the installation
        section with simplified settings which contains less configurable
        parameters in the advanced pages. However, the upgrade driver
        process does not clean up the advanced settings left by the
        inbox driver hence those undesired settings still accessible
        through the advanced property page.
      Change:
        Delete all advanced settings before install or upgrade driver.
      Impact:
        None.

   2. Problem:
       None
     cause:
       None.

      Impact:
       none.

   3. Problem:
        CQ27551, CQ27500, CQ27498 EnergyStar WOL feature does not work.
      Cause:
        The code for did not configure the phy properly when dropping
        the feature was enabled.
      Change:
        Corrected the EnergyStar feature to configure the phy correctly.
      Impact:
        None.

   4. Problem:
        CQ27588, EnergyStar feature should be enabled by default for
        devices that require the feature.
      Cause:
        Feature request.
      Change:
        Changed the default behavior to enabled for devices that require
        the feature.
      Impact:
        None.

   5. Problem:
        CQ27536, Remove Large Send Offload feature from 5906M.
      Cause:
        Feature request.
      Change:
        Removed Large Send Offload feature from 5906M.
      Impact:
        None.

      Cause:
        The cert test failed at packet size = 7268B MSS=904 at 10M/H.
        Fix for CQ27281,27241,27280 introduced a bug that long burst
        mode is mistakenly enabled for 5705 device when it's configured
        at 10M/H 6.25mhz core clock which will cause RDMA read FIFO
        overrun.
      Change:
        1. Do not enable long burst for 5705 in the GPHY power down
           code introduced in the GPHY power down fix.
        2. Set RDMA mode to "FIFO available" when the device is on
           6.25 mhz core clock.
      Impact:
        Fixed cert failure.

        5755M or 5787M is initialized with the Ethernet cable
        Unplugged and subsequently plugged in after driver has
        Finished initialization.
      Cause:
        Similar to CQ27241, CQ27280 in NDIS5x drivers,
        A coding error in the power saving enhancement for 5752M, 5755M and
        5787M controllers was powering down the GPHY DLL during
        controller initialization.
      Change:

       CQ#26857 - NDIS 6: 1c_mini6rssoids test script failed.
     cause:
       The new test kit requires driver to verify RSS settings.
     Change:
       Add code to verify RSS settings before applying.
     Impact:
       none.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ#27184 - Remove support for 5906, 5906m, 5722 and 5756ME for
        NDIS 6.0 RC driver for 9.7v.

     cause:
       A hardcoded breakpoint was left in free build causing DTM failure.
     Change:
       Removed the hardcoded BP.
     Impact:
       none.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ#27025 - Vista driver do not have vlan tagging support.
      Cause:
        In Windows Vista, Microsoft states the only correct way to
        support VLAN is using IM driver to set VLAN ID in NBL OOB.
        After discussed with MSFT, we added the VLAN ID registry
        setting as a temporarily solution for customers who want
        to support VLAN without an IM driver.
      Change:
        Added editable keyword "VLAN ID" in INF. Driver tags packets
        according to the current 801.1P/Q and VLAN ID settings.
      Impact:
        None.

  3.  Enhancement Request:

       NdisPhysicalMedium802_3.
     cause:
       New requirement in latest DTM.
     Change:
       Changed to report 802.3 as medium type at initialization.
     Impact:
       none.

  5. Problem:
       CQ#27100 Vista - Network address does not work.
       DUT only shows permanent MAC.
     cause:
       The registry key controlling the LAA is not up to the latest
       WDK document and OS. The ndis function to read the LLA registry
       key doesn't not work.
     Change:
       INF update. Changed the LAA key from *NetworkAddress to
       NetworkAddress.
     Impact:
       none.

Version 9.30.0.0a  Sep 22, 2006
Same driver binary files as prior v9.30 Driver Release
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Enhancement Request:
        The latest Vista v9.24.0.0 INF-file differs from the INBOX-INF-file
        as to where it cross-references certain OEM's.
        This will break the "unified INF-file" approach taken for the
        INBOX-INF-file v9.20.0.1.
      Change:
        Renamed all OEM specific references in the INF files.
      Impact:

        NDIS5.1 and NDIS6.0 driver can not coexist on Vista if system
        has mixed of 5703 and newer device and 5700/01/02 devices.
      Cause:
        NDIS51 and NDIS60 INF use same service displayname. Os installer
        will not allow difference services with identical display name.
      Change:
       Changed NDIS6 inf file to use display name different from ndis51
       INF file.
      Impact:
       Vista can load NDIS5.1 and NDIS6.0 driver on the same machine
       at the same time.

  2.  Problem:
        5704 won't send on system with 16GB of memory.
      Cause:
        H/W limitation on RDMA request crossing 4*N GB address boundary. This
        also applies to any devices before 5755.
      Change:
       Coalesce send fragments when detecting any fragment in a
       send packet meet such condition.
      Impact:
       Fixed the problem mentioned above. Performance impact is not
       observed.

Version 9.20.0.2  Aug 04, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       Driver cannot be unloaded after running 2c_loadunload in a loop
       overnight. It usually happens after running the script for 4
       hours.
     Cause:
       At UM_Halt, driver disables interrupt on the h/w then calls
       NDIS function to disconnect interrupt from operating system.
       There is a window that a pending DPC for Isr has been queued
       but OS has not called NDIS's DPC for Isr when driver made call
       to disconnect interrupt from IDT. NDIS will in turn a)
       deallocate interrupt object. b) NdisMDeregisterInterruptEx
       immediately return without waiting for pending DPC to complete.
       When system calls NDIS's Dpc for Isr later, NDIS will not call
       driver's Dpc for Isr routine. It leaves driver pending DPC count
       non-zero, hence, the halt function will wait until it goes to
       zero which will never happen.
     Change:
       Driver waits for pending DPC to complete after disabling
       interrupts on h/w. It only call NdisMDeregisterInterruptEx when
       pending DPC count is clear (zero).
     Impact:
       Fixed the problem as described above.

  2. Problem:
       AUT stops passing traffic in Chariot Stress test when LsoV2
       is enabled on capable NICs such as 5755/5754/5787.
     Cause:
       Driver would prematurely clear the MSS in the LSO NBL information
       structure when the driver is running out of SBD and pushes the
       NetBufferList back to the send queue. The driver would not see
       the MSS information when resending the netbufferlist after SBDs
       become available.
       The logic of setting LSO completion is carried from old code.
       This problem was in the driver since day one but it doesn't
       expose until we test it with RC1 build+LsoV2.
     Change:
       Modify the code to setup LSO completion information after
       the LSO packet was actually transmitted.
     Impact:
       Fixed the problem as described above.

Version 9.20.0.1  Jul 20, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       Driver sometimes experience linked list corruption which leads
       to different problems such as hang, data corruption etc.
     Cause:
       The function s_list_pop_head does not terminate the linked-list
       by setting the "next" field to null. If we subsequently add the
       removed entry to other linked list, it would add more entries
       than it's supposed to and the value in "cnt" field doesn't match
       the number of entries in the link list obviously.
       XP driver doesn't have this problem because it doesn't
       use any of functions from listq.h
     Change:
       Nullify the "next" field after the entry was removed from queue.
     Impact:
       None.

Version 9.20.0.0  Jun 13, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       NDIS6 driver for Vista RC 1 needs to implement new offload
       interface.
     Cause:
       This is a Vista RC 1 and RTM requirement.
     Change:
       Implemented changes to comply with the new offload interface.
       Implemented Group Keyword for TCPIP offload settings.
       Modified the code to comply with latest NDIStester tools.
     Impact:
       Driver passes RC 1 NDIStest on a patched 5452 build.

  2. Problem:
       Need to merge OEM and BRCM generic INF.
     Cause:
       This is a Vista RC 1 and RTM requirement.
     Change:
       OEM and BRCM generic INFs are merged.
     Impact:
       All IDs from these infs (based on b57win 9.52B) are included
       in the inbox INF file.

  3.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ#25620 Add 4 ID device match for new OEM project.
      Cause:
        New 4 ID device match support request by OEM. (mobile)
      Change:
        Added new 4 ID device match for OEM project.
      Impact:
        Resolve CQ#25620 Enhancement Request.

Version 9.18    Jun 24, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       Resume take  2 seconds longer if the ethernet cable is connected.
     Cause:
       NDIS6 driver does not complete a set power request timely if
       link is up before going into low power mode. The driver will
       wait for the link to come up at DPC level for seconds. This
       prevent other thread from running.
     Change:
       Driver completed the set power without waiting the link to go up.
       Driver does not indicate link status to OS during link setup right
       in the case of resuming from low power mode. It schedules a link
       check timer to finally report the link status if there is a change.
       This is to ensure driver doesn't mistakenly indicate a link down
       and indicate link up again.
     Impact:
       Fixed the problem as described.

 2.  Problem:
        CQ#25391 - 1c_KernelCalls IoGetAttachedDeviceReference
     Cause:
        This is introduced while implementing a workaround for beta 2
        NDIS.sys not being able to access PCI configuration space at
        MiniportAddDevice callback. Miniport driver hence need to get
        access to the device stack. But NDIS driver can not call
        IoGetAttachedDeviceReference.
     Change:
        Remove the IoGetAttachedDeviceReference since the driver doesn't
        really need reference to the topmost device object while accessing
        the PCI bus driver.
     Impact:
        Fixed CQ#25391.

Version 9.17    Jun 15, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Enhancement Request:
        Enable private OID support for Vista.
      Cause:
        LH NDIS wrapper will failed OIDs sent to any NDIS6 driver if
        the OIDs has not been included in the supported OID list. If
        NDIS6 driver returns private OIDs in the support list,
        IOCTLCoverage will throw random data through the advertised
        OID. The driver does not validate the contents in the input
        buffer that cause random behavior while handling private OID.
      Change:
        Modify the driver to include private OIDs in the supported
        OID list. An input buffer header was added to each private.
        The header contains signature setup by the calling application.
        Driver always validate the signature before process a private
        OID. Changes are also made to BMAPI.
      Impact:
        Driver now can passed IOCTLCoverage test with private OID
        support. BACS can talk to NDIS6 driver through the modified
        BMAPI.

  2. Problem:
       CQ#25320 NDIS6: InterruptModeration test failure
     Cause:
       Driver does not return BytesWritten.
     Change:
       Return buffer size properly.
     Impact:
       Fixed CQ#25320.

  3. Problem:
       Driver BSODs when there are more than 32 CPUs installed.
     Cause:
       Driver assumed the max number of CPUs is 32 and allocated
       a static array of 32 elements for per-CPU data. It causes
       memory overrun when the number of active CPUs is more than 32.
     Change:
       Instead of using hardcoded number, the driver gets number
       of active CPUs through newly added kernel API and allocates
       memory from non-paged pool for per-processor slot data.
     Impact:
       Driver will not crash when number of CPU is greater than 32.

  4. Problem:
       Driver initialization causes newer Vista check build to assert.
     Cause:
       Driver didn't properly clean up the RSS attribute pointer while
       registering generic attributes with ndis.
     Change:
       Change made to the initialization code to clean up the RSS
       attribute pointer if the chip does not support RSS.
     Impact:
       Fixed the assert in newer Vista check build.

Version 9.16    Jun 12, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Enhancement Request:
        CQ#24438 - Need to support MSI in NDIS 6 driver on MSI capable
        devices.
      Cause:
        The NDIS 6 driver for 57xx devices does not currently support
        MSI on *any* device, even devices that are capable of supporting
        MSI.  It is a MSFT Vista logo requirement that all PCI-E devices
        supoort MSI, and thus the driver for PCI-E devices should support
        MSI. So the driver needs to be modified to support MSI for
        Shasta Cx step devices, and all later PCI-E devices including
        Baxter, Stanford, Jade, and Caeser. The driver should not support
        MSI on Shasta A/B steps due to known HW errata regarding MSI in
        those devices. At this time the driver is not required to support
        MSI on non PCI-e devices.
      Change:
        Added code support MSI in ndis6 driver. Change INF to enable OS
        to assign MSI resources for devices newer than Shasta. The driver
        implemented code to filter out MSI resources and roll back to INTX
        for Shasta A/B steps based on chip rev read from PCI config 0x68.
      Impact:
        MSI now is supported on Shasta CX and up.

      Impact:
        Resolve latest requirement for CQ#24766

Version 9.15.0.0    May 12, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       CQ#24741 INF Scrub for Vista Inbox Driver Revealed Missing Support
       for Some Chips and Invalid 4-part IDs.
     Cause:
       Some 2-Part IDs are missing and invalid 4-Part IDs.
     Change:
       Added required 2-Part IDs and removed invalid 4-Part IDs.
     Impact:
       Fixed CQ#24741.
  2. Problem:

     Impact:
       Picked up latest changes, fixes to the XP driver.

Version 9.14.0.0  May 5, 2006
Merged from 9.4.2.9
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       There are multiple synchronization problems in code paths,
       such as the Pause/Restart, Reset, Halt, PowerManagement, interrupt
       and DPC handling etc.
     Cause:
       Vista OS appears to be more asynchronous which would trigger
       some race conditions in the some code inherent from the old design.
     Change:
       Make disabling/enabling interrupt synced with ISR, ensure no pending
       DPC after interrupt has been disabled. Re-write RX code so that is
       clean and easy to sync with other operations such as reseting, pausing,
       restarting, switching between power modes. Driver can not be safely reset
       in most case so the reset code has been changed to asynchronous.
     Impact:
       Fixed many race conditions reported by MSFT during their internal
       test and deployment.

  2.  Enhancement Request:
        Use in-stack spinlock to improve performance in performance critical
        Path.
      Cause:
        Enhancement.
      Change:
        Use in stack spinlock to improve performance in performance critical
        Path.
      Impact:
        Enhance spinlock performance.

  3. Problem:
       Interrupt coalescing doesn't work and CPU usage is high under heavy
       traffic.
     Cause:
       Driver disables interrupt at ISR and invoke DPC. DPC will continuously
       check status block update and process send and receive events until
       a) no more status block update event b) DPC has executed more than
       10 ms c) DPC loop count has been reached. When DPC is running, no
       interrupt is generated hence the interrupt count is very low. The
       interrupt coalescing logic believes the device is not generating
       many interrupts/events and won't kick in.
     Change:
       change made to the DPC to increment the interrupt count when it detects
       a new status block update so that the interrupt coalescing logic will
       engage to coalesce the host-attention events.
     Impact:
       Reduced CPU utilization under heavy traffic and improve PEI.

Version 9.12.0.0  March 24, 2006
----------------------------------------
  1. Problem:
       NDIS6 driver need to pick up latest changes from XP driver.
     Cause:
       Merge of NDIS5.x driver changes is required.
     Change:
       Synced files upto 03/06/2006 from b57xp32 v9.20.
     Impact:
       None.

  2. Problem:
       Vista 5308 Network Connection displays 1Gb while adapter is
       initialized with a 10/100Mb link.
     Cause:
       NDIS in this build assumes the link speed to be the Max Speed
       the driver has advertised at initialization without sending
       OID to query current link speed.
     Change:
       The Link Done Timer routine will test the current link speed
       if the link is active. It compares the current speed against
       the Max Speed advertised at initialization time, it indicates
       link speed change event to NDIS if current link speed does not
       equal to Max Link Speed.
     Impact:
       Network connection correctly shows link speed.

  3.  Enhancement Request:

Version 9.6.0.0  March 3, 2006
----------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        CQ23438 System with 5752M fails to get DHCP address on boot
        if LAN cable was disconnected during OS boot and later
        connected after user log on to Windows.
      Cause:
        A non recoverable Read DMA error occurs in this test scenario,
        due to NIC's internal core clock being automatically slowed down
        by logic in the device when the GPHY DLL is  automatically powered
        down when CAT 5 cable is disconnected.
        The GPHY DLL automatically gets powered down and NIC's internal
        core clock gets slowed down when the CAT 5 cable disconnected,
        this is an intended design power saving feature.
        Unfortunately, the slowed down of the core-clock causes Read DMA
        error, which resulted in the system failed to acquire the IP address
        via DHCP.
      Change:
        Modified driver code to Not  Enable the GPHY DLL Auto-Power-Down
        feature of hardware for 5752M Devices.
      Impact:
        Higher power consumption on these devices when the device is
        enabled, but the network link is down.
        Resolve CQ23438 issue.

  2.  Problem:
        CQ23551 Disable GPHY DLL power-down on 5752M, 5754M,
        5755M, and 5787M Devices.
      Cause:
        Same problem as CQ23438 would occur for the listed devices.
        A non recoverable Read DMA error occurs in this test scenario,
        due to NIC's internal core clock being automatically slowed down
        by logic in the device when the GPHY DLL is  automatically powered
        down when CAT 5 cable is disconnected.
        The GPHY DLL automatically gets powered down and NIC's internal

        error, which resulted in the system failed to acquire the IP address
        via DHCP.
      Change:
        Modified driver code to Not Enable the GPHY DLL Auto-Power-Down
        feature of hardware for all  5752M, 5754M, 5755M, 5787M Devices.
      Impact:
        Higher power consumption on these devices when the device is
        enabled, but the network link is down.
        Resolve CQ23551 issue.

  3. Problem:
       NDIStester 6.5 Offloadchecksum failure on 5715/14/80 devices.
     Cause:
       The driver mistakenly enables pseudo header checksum on
       5714/5715/5780 devices.
     Change:
       Made change to the code so that 5714/5715/5780 devices will
       not calculate pseudo header checksum on TX path.
     Impact:
       Passed NDIStestv6.5.

Version 9.6  March 3, 2006
Merged from 9.4.1.x branch
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        1516254 Broadcom: b57nd60a / b57nd60x: 0x9F during stress:
                DRIVER_POWER_STATE_FAILURE (9f)
        1523492 Broadcom: b57nd60a/b57nd60x: drivers fails to send
                complete packets causing multiple issues.
      Cause:
        A race conditions in LM_EnableInterrupt and UM_Reset enables
        interrupt twice. It causes interrupt being re-enabled after
        DPC had disabled it.
      Change:
        Have the LM_EnableInterrupt sync with ISR and test if interrupt
        is unmasked before enabling interrupt.
      Impact:
        Resolved MSFT reported 1516254 and 1523492 on CTP release.

  2.  Problem:
        1502715 Broadcom: b57nd60a.sys: v9.5.0.0: X64_0xD1_W_b57nd60a!
                MM_IndicateRxPackets+32b: miniport is indicating packets
                up when OID_GEN_CURRENT_PACKET_FILTER is not set
      Cause:
        The UM_Restart routine turns on the OkToIndicate flags without
        testing the current packet filter. NDIS clears packet filter
        when pausing a miniport. When Miniport gets restarted, NDIS does
        not expect miniport to indicate any RX packet until it turns on
        the packet filter.
      Change:
        Do not set OkToIndicatePackets when restarting miniport.
      Impact:
        Resolved MSFT reported 1502715 on CTP release.

  3.  Problem:
        1513694 Broadcom: b57nd60x.sys "\Network Interface(*)\Bytes Sent/sec"
        counter 0 for Broadcom NetXtreme 57xx Gigabit Controller (NDIS6.0).
      Cause:
        Driver doesn't fully support OID_GEN_STATISTICS.
      Change:
        Implemented OID_GEN_STATISTICS as required.
      Impact:
        Resolved MSFT reported 1513694 on CTP release.

Version 9.5   January 31, 2006
----------------------------------------------------------------------
  1.  Problem:
        Assert during 2c_PMSleep.wsf.
      Cause:
        While fixing RSS shutdown crash on suspend, there is a bug
        being introduced causing NON-RSS devices to leave RX BDs in
        RX return ring, then LM_SetPowerState waits at dispatch level.
      Change:
        Release main spinlock before calling LM_SetPowerState.
      Impact:
        2c_PMSleep won't assert.

  2.  Problem:
        Halting adapter BSOD.
      cause:
        While fixing RSS shutdown crash on suspend, there is a bug
        being introduced causing NON-RSS devices to leave RX BDs in
        RX return ring. This effectively messed up the RX resource
        accounting.
      Change:
        Fix in LM_Abort to make sure non-RSS nics correctly collect
        RX BDs in RX return ring before returning.
      Impact:
        Halting non-RSS adapter won't BSOD.

  1. Problem:
         Broadcom driver reports MTU of 1514 in NDISMSetMiniportAttribute ?
         MTU should not include header and should report 1500.  TCP then add 14 to the MTU;
         causing IPSec to interpret this as a corrupted packet
       cause:
         Incorrectly report MTU size at initialization.
       Change:
         Report MTU size correctly, MTU should not include header.
       Impact:
         Resolve reported issue.

  2. Problem:
         Use DDK-5287 to build the driver.

Version 9.0 January 10, 2006
----------------------------------------
  1.  Initial release.

  Overall:
      This initial release of BRCM NetExtreme NDIS 6.0 Driver was tested to
      perform the best with Microsoft Longhorn (Vista) Beta build version 5270,
      and all tests were performed using MSFT NDIS Test 6.0.6.

      Although this version (9.0) of BRCM NetExtreme NDIS 6.0 Driver had encountered
      some problems during testing, but we believe most of the problems are MSFT
      Longhorn (Vista) OS and/or NDIS Test tool related.

      BRCM is actively engaged with MSFT regarding the "known issues", and are
      working with MSFT in driving the resolutions.

      This BRCM NetExtreme NDIS 6.0 Driver support BRCM NetExtreme chip family
      starting from BCM5703, 5704, CIOB-E, 5705, 5751, 5752, 5754, 5755, 5787,
      5714, 5715, HTLE and derivatives.  This NDIS 6.0 Driver removed the support
      for BCM 5700, 5701 and 5702 chips.

  Known issues:
      CQ13764: DPC timeout -- LH 5216.vbl_ndt_netio DPC watchdog timeout with
               b57xp32 on the stack (reported by MSFT).
      CQ22245: DPC timeout -- 5751C1 freezes OS when IPV6 Chariot traffic is
               applied
      CQ22290: DPC timeout -- Running Chariot IPV6 stress traffic causes OS to
               lock-up when LSO is disabled
      CQ22305: DPC timeout -- 5787mA1 cannot complete NDIS6 tester
               2c_mini6Performance.wsf test script

          Note: DPC timeout is an OS issue where the newly introduced
                DPC watchdog in Windows Vista mistakenly flags the driver 30
                seconds timeout at DISPATCH level. MSFT is actively
                looking into this issue.

      CQ22282: NDIS6 tester exhibits runtime script error when
               2c_mini6RSSSendRecv is executed
          This appears to be a test kit issue, MSFT is looking into this.
